Heyyy. Well, come on in. Found the place, did ya? Been meaning to hang out a new sign. "Fredo's Electronics Repair." It's real nice. And uh, yeah, I'm Fredo.
Heyyy.
Been lotsa outsiders coming through lately. Some kind of festival or something in Arulco? Ah, guess I missed it.
Hey, just between you and me, remember my name. I'm going to be taking this country wireless in a year or two. Already ordered four routers.
No, man. I don't get no charge out of it. Heh. Get it?
Well, we don't have to make small talk. If there's something you need me to do, just say so.
Yeah, sometimes when the atmosphere is filled with negatively charged particles, you're really at its mercy. It's a common manifestation, but it'll pass, man.
You kidding? Bullets and broads, the two things that'll shorten a man's life.
Damn... uh, this stings!
Well, I got about ten different things to do, so I'll leave you to look around.
It's my policy to take money once I know what I'm suppossed to be fixing. You know what I mean?
Something you need me to fix? Let's see it, man.
You know, I was thinking, why don't they make a microwave with a blender? Saves time! Your food's cooked AND pre-chewed. You know what I mean?
I got quick turnaround here. I can pretty much guarantee most work by the next day. Even the big guys can't do that.

This the stuff that needs fixing?
All right. Let me get a good look at it, man.
Sorry, man... I only work on electronics.
Whaddya mean? Looks fine to me.
Man, this is gonna need some serious work. I'll have to charge you extra for my time.
Oh, yeah. This is kid stuff! I'll get it back in shape.
Almost, but you still owe me, man.
Precision is an artform. Thanks, man.
All right, and let me give you your change here...
Thanks man, and spread the word, will ya? Your stuff'll be ready as soon as I can get to it. Should be no later than late tomorrow.
Well, you know where to come if you got problems.
Heyyy, don't be leaving your stuff behind. I got enough junk as it is.
Oh, got lots of stuff to do here already. How about I take care of this first?
You butthole!
Sorry, man. It's not ready yet. I got kinda bogged down with some work for Hans. The guy owns an adult shop in Drasnia. Has some annoying client that burns through her toys like there's no tomorrow. Try me later.
You nuts? I'm not talking to you while you're a target!
Hmmm, interesting. A gun that works by fingerprint. I could probably erase the existing setting. Take some tinkering. Best I can do is reset it though. Means the first person to use it will be the only person to use it.
Hey, man. It's Miller Time for me, and time to go for you. I have to close up.
Thanks, man. It was looking touch and go there for a while.

What can I do for you?
It is hopeful, yes?
We are grateful for your presence.
I hope we'll be all right.
No, I do not want this.
There is no one more evil than Deidranna.
There is no need for anger. We fight for the same cause.
The time is not right. I am needed in the rebel base.
Wounded. I will die for sure.
I have to go now.
Do not move and no one will die.
Enrico? Chivaldori? Most suspicious. I question his reasons.
I am impressed with your leadership. I will join because it is best for Arulco.
An act of aggression against one of us is an act of aggression against all of us. Your fate is decided!
We are short of food, too, Miguel. We need safe passage to Lodenburg or more people will die.
It will aid our efforts. Thank you.
Are you sure this is wise, Miguel?
This situation has grown desperate. The rebel base remains without supplies for its people. When will this change?
Our people are suffering in hunger. You must do something. It cannot continue without the loss of more life.
You have made progress, but we must exercise caution. We have not heard the last from Deidranna.
I see hope in the eyes of the people, a hope I have not seen in a long time. But I shall deny myself this feeling until victory is within our hands.
Almost half the country is ours, but we still have much work to do.

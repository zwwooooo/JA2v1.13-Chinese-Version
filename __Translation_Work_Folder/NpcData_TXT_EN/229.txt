I am Manuel. Perhaps, Miguel or Carlos has talked of me.
You have come back.
What happened in Arulco is terrible.
I eat so much fish over years that I do not think I can drown.
I can not take that.
I survived in hiding a long time, because I was determined.
I will not hurt you.
The time is not good.
Help me... I suffer... great pains.
Maybe, it safer for us if we go different ways.
Thank you. I will buy something for my son.
You will pay... with your blood.
You bring attention. I will talk when it is safe.
You helped my family and friends, so I return favor. I ask only that we not waste time. I very much want to go to Arulco and see my wife, Fatima, and son, Pacos.
In Tracona, I learn how to hide and move quietly. It has kept me alive. This I am sure will help us.
I expect you. Friends in rebel base deliver message that you'd be coming. It is good to be able to talk to someone again. I have been hiding in Tracona alone for many years. It was only safe place for me.
A long time ago, I wanted to join the rebels to overthrow Deidranna. Miguel Cordona had different plan. He gave me new identity, and told me to join Arulcan Army. I would act as man on inside - infiltrator.
I did this for many years, I became Sergeant. Until I was discovered. I not sure how this happened, but I was told that a man named Kingpin in Duranth learned of me. And he told the Queen to earn her favor.
I left right away, at night. I could not go to rebel base, because it would put Fatima in danger. So, I cross border and hide here. When I left, I was most wanted man in Arulco.
I am husband of Fatima and father of Pacos. I heard what happened by messenger from rebel base. I am the last person you wanted to meet in Tracona!




Now, Arulco is safe again...with many thanks to you. I wish go to rebel base and see family and friends. Maybe even some soldiers from Arulcan Army will be friends again.
I owe you my life.
My country owes you, so I will join, again!

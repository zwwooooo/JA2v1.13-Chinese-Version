Hold your fire. I will not harm you.
It be good to see you again.
I have family, son, daughter and beautiful wife. I want to go home to them. Not to die here.
This is not the future I had in mind. The Arulcan army drafted me, and left me no choice.
No, it is better with you.
You have long road ahead, and I will not stand in your way. Please, just let me go.
I beg you to reconsider. Is not what you think! I am here by force.
No, I can't. They would catch me, and it would be much, much worse.
Medicine... doctor.
Perhaps, I go now. I remember to say good word for you amongst the people of the town.
Ah, that is better.
You leave no choice.
I have proposition for you if you spare my life. I know where you can get a weapon. A very special weapon developed by the Queen's researchers in Nasa. They are only given to her elite guards.
It is a powerful rifle that fires laser-guided, miniature rockets. This weapon is so destructive that its use is limited to the person whose fingerprints are encoded in the firing mechanism.
The fingerprint can be reset, but it would require someone with a good knowledge of electronics and a great deal of time if they are unfamiliar with it... Spare my life, and it is yours.
It is a deal. I will trust you to keep your end of the bargain. I promise to speak highly of you amongst my friends and family, many of whom are in a position of influence.
Here. It is brand new. The fingerprint of the user has not yet been set, so you must choose the first person to use it carefully. Only they will be able to fire it. I will not forget what you have done.
Very well...
Sh. Thanks. I keep it between us.

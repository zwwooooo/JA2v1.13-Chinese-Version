Figured you'd be showin' sooner or later.
Back away, soldier.
You're playing with your life, soldier.
Your time will come.
I don't accept bribes.
You're not getting the hint, are ya?
Why don't you go play in some crossfire, kid. I'm not the least bit scared of ya.
You must be joking.
Call a medic!
Enjoy your life while it lasts, soldier!
All right. Now, buzz off.
Prepare to die!
Do not allow yourself to believe you're anywhere close to winning this war, soldier. Deidranna has Gryfindor fortified enough to stop an army. Any army!
And while you're wasting your time mingling amongst the peasants, she's building new weapons in Nasa. Weapons like you've never seen, soldier.
I don't want your money, soldier.

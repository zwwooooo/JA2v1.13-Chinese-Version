Come on, make my day!
Let's dance, baby!
I shoot you!
Get lead, you soldier of misfortune!
Sapingos here! Get the shit out! Dale marimberos!
Just couldn't mind your own damn business, could you?
I've got a surprise with your name on it.
Un mercenario criminal!
El Diablo! I will destroy you with my prayers. And a little firepower!
Die, you Arulcan dog!
When you're burning in hell, keep a place for your bitch queen, cause she's coming next!
You're just another notch on my gun!
You can kiss your ass goodbye!
You're gonna need a bigger gun!
First you, and then on to that hag you call your queen!

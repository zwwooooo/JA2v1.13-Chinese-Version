Oi, where the bloody hell d'you think you're goin' aye?
Listen chief, unless you're bringing in strippers from San Mona I couldn't care less.
Well I appreciate your bargaining technique! But it'll still cost you some coin if you want to hire me...

Nah mate, I don't take back handers.

Don't give me aggro, I'm toey as it is, you give me more aggro and I'm likely to go Troppo for sure!
Sorry chief, Hale and Burton pay me good wages, shame I can't spend it on much around here mind you.
Fair go, I think I picked up one on the way.
I've got plenty of things to do around here, one being trying to find a half decent Shelia who aint gonna give me the clap for starters!
That's a restricted area! Stop or we'll open fire!
I'm not getting paid to be standing around here chatting with you, mate.
Mmmmm, now you're talking, time to break the drought!
Av-a-go-yer-mug
Two and a half grand is my base rate, plus any goodies I pick up on the way, but look at me, mate...I'm worth it!
It's a goer then! Hunting the Queen sure will beat hanging out in this sausage-fest, this place is too full of bean counters and FIGJAMS for my liking. So while we're at it, got any more Sheilas in the squad?

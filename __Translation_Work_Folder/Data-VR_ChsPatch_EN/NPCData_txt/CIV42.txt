Are you allied with the Traconian Army?
Did you know that Arulco was just a constituent of former Great-Tracona?
The Arulcan Army is nothing compared to us.
They have sown their own destiny by prostituting themselves and their resources to the dumb white business man. 
Maybe I take a nice Arulcan woman for me in Tracona after the occupation.
Occupation? What the hell are we supposed to occupy here? Local latrine?
I can't wait to get back to Tracona.
I don't care. Move along.
I swear, one more cockroach in my oat meal and the chef gets shot.
After this all is over, I'm quitting army and becoming mercenary. Easy money, exotic countries, hot women... What could go wrong? 
I'm not in the mood for chit-chat.
Hey, get back to whatever backass country you came from. There's nothing for you here.
Hey, what has three legs, rotten teeth, smells like piss and can't count to ten? I don't know, but if not the "three legs" part, any Arulcan would fit!
...and then he says - "I'm just a tourist!"
Join the army, be a man, visit great new countries. And now I'm stuck in this fucking backwater shithole.

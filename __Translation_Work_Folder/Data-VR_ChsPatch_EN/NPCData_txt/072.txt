Evil spirits are everywhere! Spirits and MAGGOTS!
A lot of worms.
I'm not a zombie!
Do you hear?!
VOODOO!!!
They have crawled, creeping things...
HO HO!
I don't want to work for you anymore!
The bleeding has to be stopped. I don't want to be a zombie!
Spirits don't like to say the same thing twice.
Spirits are happy.
Spirits DAMN YOU!
Spirits say this area is clear.
Spirits don't like waiting.
Ha, Ha, Ha...
I am not here.

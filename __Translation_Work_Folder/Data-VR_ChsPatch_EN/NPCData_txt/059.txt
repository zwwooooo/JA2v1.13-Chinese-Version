Hi, I'm Megan Roachburn, call me Sparky.
Ah, there you are again.
Since Miguel disappeared, the rebels' morale took a dive big time.

No thanks, I don't need that.
You get to hear about things around these parts. Heard you want to clean up again... I'd love to be part of it.
Watch your mouth, buddy!
No, I don't trust you.
I need medical help!
Well, somethin' else?
Have you met Sandman yet? He's my son.

Very good! You won't regret it. Us Roachburns, we're battle field legends.
I have many talents. But Sandman and I, we're THE team.
You goddamn bitch! You'll pay for that!
Hm. Thanks.

Could you shut your yap for two darn seconds?!? ...before someone guns me down.


I've worked for A.I.M. too, had a big job in Metavira.
Now I'm working as a security consultant down here.

You have come back!
You have come back?!
An unexploded bomb in Omerta got me while I was playing outside with Pacos. That's why I'm sitting in a wheelchair now.
There is a doctor in the States who could help me, but we don't have no money and no possibility to travel to him.
I can not take that!
I survived in hiding a long time, because I was determined.
You are threatening a man who is in a wheelchair? How pathetic.
Well, I even helped you once, but now I can't do that anymore.
Help me... I suffer... great pains.
Maybe, it safer for us if we go different ways.
Gracias! I will buy something for my son.
Go playing into the house Pacos, dad is speaking with the uncle.
I owe you my life!
The army mined the hospital. I can't be operated in Arulco.
Pacos tried to get Kingpins money? The naive boy.
I hope I'll live until this coup has ended.
Since I'm sitting in the wheelchair only Pacos can help me. But he hasn't returned for days.
He would try to get money for my operation. To fly into a foreign country.
Since Fatima is dead, Pacos took care of me. But now I have to ask you to bring him back.
The underground says that Miguel is still alive. They want sentence him to death!
There're few places where he can be. I think he'll be in the justice palace in Malino or in the labour camp in the desert.
If you find him, bring him back! Nobody else than you can help me.

I know that you're very busy, but Pacos disappeared again. Could you find him again please? You're my last chance.

It seems like it was yesterday as I hided me in Tracona. I have missed my son very much.
Fatima was shot as a collaborationist. I think I recognized her murderer.
Dios mio! My heart!
You will pay... with your blood!
For thanking you I tell you from the underground: In Burton there're tunnels many tunnels. So you get easily from the palace to the private heliport of the Queen!
Thank you for your care!
Protect me! Por favor...
The underground confirmed me: Miguel is imprisoned in Malino.

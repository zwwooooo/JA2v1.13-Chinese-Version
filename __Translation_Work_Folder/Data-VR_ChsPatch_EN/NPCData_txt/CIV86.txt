The hours are long, and the work is hard, but the pay's gonna put my kids through college by the time I'm done here.
I'm just counting down the hours 'til this shift's over!
You really should be wearing safety gear here.
I'm gonna work my way up, got my sights on being a crane operator looking down on all y'all.
Aye man, you look like you could swing a few pipes, ever thought of a change of career?
I keep my head down and mouth shut.
Unions? Arulco don't have no unions, the Queen saw to that!
'scuse me, I'm a tryin' to work here!
Man my contract didn't say nothing about bullets flying around while we worked!
This aint the best place to relax, but I suppose the hum of the plant is more peaceful than a crack of an AK!
You should probably talk to the CRO. Maybe you can convince him to help you.
I'm just a roustabout, you need to talk to the head man up at the offices.
Us work for YOU? I don't mind as long as I'm paid, but the head operator at the control room makes the decisions here.
Have you spoken to the manager? He's the one running things. You need to talk to him, not me.
Is this a hostile takeover? I don't want no trouble, talk to the head honcho at the office for that!

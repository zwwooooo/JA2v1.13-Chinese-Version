Hello. I'm the vice-governor.
So you come again. Mui bene.
Have you already talked to Enrico?
I tell you, this war, it tear Arulco apart. I don't know how much more the people can take. Is good to see people like you make difference.
No, I no need anything, but thank you.
Someday, we will return to the peaceful Arulco that I loved as a child.
You yell at a me. Why you yell?
Is too dangerous for me. Soldiers scare me.
Could you... please... get doctore?
Now I will try to get back to affairs of state.

You fool!



I believe under the circumstances that would be useful.
With this thing you can authorize yourself. The weapons you're searching for are hidden in the jungle, in the northeast of here.













What? I no can talk now! I fear for my life.

You will free us. I know this. And I thank you.

Thank you.

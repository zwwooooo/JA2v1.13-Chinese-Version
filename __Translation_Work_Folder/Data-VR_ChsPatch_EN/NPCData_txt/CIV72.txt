Howdy, ehrm, fellow Arulcan?
Can't speak right now, I'm on a super secret... I mean... err... Nice weather, huh?
Me? I work for a... ugh, import-export company.
You know what this country needs? A fast-food franchise!
Nothing interesting here, friend. Move along.
Can't you see I'm busy?
You just can't find any good donuts in these parts.
No suspicious activities over here! Keep moving!
...they suspect something. Tango, over. ... Hi there, friend! I was just talking to myself! Yep!
Just minding my own business, friend.
Of course I'm local. I can even show you my birth certificate - which I just happen to have with me - if you still don't believe me.
Hey, don't look at me like that! You're making me paranoid!
Stop asking me questions! What are you, some conspiracy nut?
CIA? Never heard of 'em.
Oh, you know, just chilling over here.

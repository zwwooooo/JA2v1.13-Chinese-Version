I've got an enemy in sight!
I got an enemy sighted up and ready for a box!
I've got my hands full here!
Spotted one!
That can't be right!
This locale looks suspicious...
I'm a little concerned..
Well... well...
This locale looks suspicious...
They must have known we were closing in.
You can't leave me behind!
I see something here.
I see something here.
I need some lead. And I need it now!
Need help... I'm fading fast!
Mike... Mike... Answer me, Mike... Ah geez!


I'll have to get more specific directions!
Crap! My gun won't fire!
I'm taking heat here! I want to build a little fire of my own!
I'm taking it here!
Is this the best you can do?
Nobody could make that shot from here!
I'm bleeding...
We're pushing it.
I'm out of breath...
Ready to be boxed!
Don't bug me no more!
Larry might have everyone else fooled with this new goody two-shoes act, but I know him way too well to fall for it.
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm out of here!

Mike... Mike... Answer me, Mike... Ah geez!
You should order more body bags!
I got too many options.
I knew with me around... The job would get done.
I don't do that kind of thing!
Ya... We did it!
You can open your eyes now!
I'm gonna make this guy sorry he ever messed with me!
This mission is a washout!
Want me to waste one of us? I'll waste one of us!
This place is going to blow!
This thing's a piece of garbage! Doesn't anything work around here?
I should have brought a book.
Get your hands off me!
Consider yourself lucky...
Personally, I take dead between the ear moves like that as a warning.
It wasn't my fault!
Lookie, lookie! It's my loser brother, Larry.
Lookie, lookie! It's my loser brother, Larry.
Mike's my idol!


We tried to work it out. Didn't happen... Don't bother me anymore.
Crraaap... it's Mike. I don't want to do this... Mike's my idol!
I've been luckier.
I'm not good at this kind of stuff!
You're welcome.
With me in charge, they won't stand a chance.
You're going to be sorry you messed with me!
Finding this could get me a reward...
Kiss my rifle butt!
Somebody should make sure he gets back safely.
With me in charge, you can count on it.
I think we got the last one around here.
We got screwed bad!
You deserve it!
Spotted one!
With me on your side, they didn't have a chance!
I wish they were all this easy.
The day's over.
I'm back in charge.
I guess so.
This thing is a piece of garbage! Doesn't anything work around here?
I'm not sure about this. Something's wrong...
The ground looks suspicious.
I can't breathe... I'm DRO...WNING!
I'm here! Now what?

I'd never join up with someone like you!
I'm a little concerned. Too many mercs are dying.
It's a good possibility. I'll need some time to weigh all my options.
No. I still don't feel much like it.
Well... Well... Busy, busy! Leave your message after the tone and I'll get back to you.
It wasn't that bad working for you. I guess if you need my services again you can call.
I don't work with my brother, 'anything but a placebo' Larry!
I don't work with my brother, 'anything but a placebo' Larry!

You're welcome.
Fortunate for you, money is tight right now... So, I'll take it.
It's your lucky day. We're on!
Mike's on your team? I'll join... even though you don't deserve me.


No... I don't feel much like it.
Try listening...
How you planning on paying me?
You seem to be a little quick with the axe!
You're not even worth listening to anymore!
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm ? out of here!
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm ? out of here!

I'll sign... As long as Mike's on your team.


Try listening...
I'm outta here! You can't even get a decent haircut for that kind of money.
I'm the best man for the job!
I've got a bigger mouth than my father, and I'm a heck of a lot younger.
My father wasn't badmouthing me, was he?
You probably don't deserve me but I'll join.
Forget this... You're not taking me serious enough.
Killing Larry will get me back into my old man's good books.
Killing Larry will get me back into my old man's good books.
The clock's working against us.
I was a little disappointed in the numbers, so, I'll give you another shot at making a deal. This time make me proud.

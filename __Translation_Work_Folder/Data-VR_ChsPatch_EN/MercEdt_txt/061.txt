I see one!
It's starting again!
Hey! Someone help me please?!

Um, what's that?!

Shhht! There is something!




Discovered something!
He who looked shall find!
Get me some ammo!
*Cough* I am so cold... this is going to be the end...urgh..
No! These pigs killed Sparky! She was like a mother for me!
Damn it, Static! They'll regret this one, I promise you!
Wolf!...my man... I will never forget you.
Focus..focus...where was I?
Heeey! This bloody weapon is stuck! But I can still throw it.
Damn it! Not everyone at once!
Man, life can suck bad!
Ha, ha, these pigs almost hit me!
And this was it already?
Medic!
Oh man, no one can stand this!
...I can't take it anymore...
Took care of one!




Hey Mike! This is what happens when you abandon your old friends.
Yay, right in the center!

All done, anything else?
And you think I am going to make this?!


What an idiot!
Oh, all this makes no sense!
Does anyone on the team have a clue about anything?

What shit is this?! Does anything work around here?
A bunch of wacko around me who can't do anything!
...blah...blah... *mumble... whine*
And again I learned something!
I don't think this is going to work...
Hm. I was waiting for that.


Like old times, what do you think Sparky?
Nobody can do it better than Static!
Yeah! Nice, Wolf!
Hey boss, I am entitled to something!
Hey boss, no dough, I'll leave!
Argh! I can't see...ahhh!
Can't do anything boss!
Looks like he is a nice guy.
Hey boss, there are enemies here!
We are not done yet boss! They are still somewhere!
Yeah, that's it!!
Wicked piece!
Ah, there is the boy. Off with you to your home!
You are not interested anymore, hu? Have a nice day!
How would you know! All enemies are dead!
Something is missing... I think the guy swiped something.
The bitch deserved it!
Uhh, a kitty!
A good deed done. The land really deserved it. Also good team work. It was fun. I hope you are going to hire me again another time!
What?! I can't believe it! These pig simply ran away.
*Yawn* I am a little tired.
Alright boss, I am done sleeping and ready to go.
I agree!
Shit! Everything but that!
Ah, this is a trap. You'll need a professional!
There is indeed a land mine lying here.
Help! I am drowning!
And there we are!

Your beliefs will soon change.
All your life you have rejected the ways of your ancestors.
Don't be afraid.
It must be stopped.
They come to cleanse the land of all living things.
Dark ones.
It is time.
I sense great change.

Threatens all of humanity.  It must be stopped.
Don't be afraid.
I have something to show you.
Let me show you.
Consumed by the fires of the sun.
Go now.  I shall await you in the land of the ancients.
Your name will forever be held sacred here.
She is bound to this land.


Quit screwing around.
Do something.
You must go.
This too shall pass.
No it is not yet your time.
You must learn the old medicine.
Go now to the spirit cave.
Pay heed.
Now you must embrace your heritage.
Destroyed.





Pay heed to the dark ones.
Even now the spirts of our ancestors fight to protect this sacred place.
All your life you have rejected the ways of your ancestors.
It is the only way.
It is the only way.
You must leave this place.
You must leave this place.
Spirit resides here now.

If there is something better in this life, I have not seen it.


If there is something better in this life, I have not seen it.
Quit screwing around.



Show them the power of our people.
My place is here by your side.  You will have need of me this night.




Not yet your time.
And there is one who wishes to thank you above all.
The dark ones seek to invade this land.
There is far more at stake.
Your ancestors smile on you.
It is the only way.
You must go.
Run.  Get out of here.
Now you must take the fight to them.
I came to warn you.
She is bound to this land.
Stop this invasion.
Destroyed. Consumed by the fires of the sun.  The land of the ancients is restored.
I sense great change on the winds.


Listen.
Sense the coming of the storm.
Get out of here.
Run.  Get out of here.

The path before you is long.

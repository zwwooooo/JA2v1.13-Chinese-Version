Enemy in view.
We've got trouble.
I'm overloaded here!
We got one of those whatchamacallits.
Holy Mother of...what the hell do you call that?
Those giant thingamabobs must've come this way.
I don't know what I just heard, but I don't like it.
Ecch...smells rotten, like one of those big whatever-they-ares.
I don't like how quiet it is.
Sure hope we don't bump into a big whozeewhatsis.
These things aren't playing fair!
What's that?
There seems to be something over there.
An empty weapon is never good.
Hope I don't look as bad as I feel.



I got distracted. Give it to me again.
This gun's jammed.
I'm in the hotseat here!
Was that supposed to hurt?
Suddenly I feel really glad to be alive.
I'm not very confident about that shot.
Permission to stop bleeding, somebody?
I'm about to fall asleep on my feet.
Need to breathe.
Another down.
Killed one.




I hate to look at that kind of thing.

I'm finished my task.
I can't comply with that order.
All right, go home, there's nothing to see here.
I've got to believe that thing was here for a reason...but damned if I know what that could've been.
Hate to say it, but what a loser.
I don't feel like I'm doing any good here. And being here isn't doing me much good either.
I get the feeling that everybody on this team is only out for themselves.
Enemy planes approaching.
Everything I've got either needs repair or replacement. This is no way to wage a battle.


Improvement. Feels good.
I believe we need a better approach.
I'm hardly surprised that didn't go as intended.






That chopper pilot's a madman. He made me nauseous. Oh, well... It's off to find Miguel.
Ow, got me in the eyes. Ah, they're on fire!
Surely, there's something else I could be doing.
Wish I met her under other circumstances.
There are enemies in proximity.
There's at least one of them isn't accounted for. Could be waiting for the right moment to surprise us.
Here's something to perk up my day.

Isn't that Joey Graham over there?
Not with us here, she won't. Count on it.
One for our side! All enemies are down.
It appears there's been a theft here. Stuff's missing.
Forgive me for being cold and calculating, but that man was a complete zero in any book. They'll probably throw us a parade.
Cougar!
My first mission ever, and I'm proud to say that you got me through it. Well done, from beginning to end.
They musta slipped out. No enemy presence in the sector.
I'll grab a few z's and get back on the job.
Rested and returning to work.
I was just going to say that.
Maintenance could have prevented this. Now, it's nothing but dead weight.
This's got "deadly" written all over it.
Watch out. I'd keep my toes off of that.
Need a... line here! I'm... drowning! Anyone...
Safe arrival. I'm prepared for the next assignment.

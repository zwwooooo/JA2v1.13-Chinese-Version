Found one!
Got a bullet with their name on it!
This is gonna get worse before it gets better!
There's one!
Yup, I'm not surprised.
Awww... Alien residue?.
I can hear them, but I can't see them...
What the hell is that smell?
Shit is goin' down!
We're being hunted...
Yeah! Kill 'em all!
Check that one for ammo.
Free stuff!
I'm out, need more ammo!
Urgh...this is it...uh. It's too late to become religious now.



Wait, repeat last transmission, please sir?
Gun won't fire!
I'm drawing a lot of fire here.
Ha! Who trained these guys?!
Shit! Someone's going for me!
I can't see what you are telling me to shoot at.
Medic!
Requesting a rest, sir.
Need a quick break here...  
Enemy down!
Enemy down!




Ya think they're dead?

Mission accomplished, sir.
Can't do that, sir.
Ain't nuthin' but nuthin'.
That should slow 'em down!
Somebody else deal with this person please.
Man! Shoulda done some research on this mission before I agreed to it...

That's not good!
I could function better, with more suitable gear...


Think I'm gettin' better.
Not quite sure about this one...
Wasn't too sure about that to begin with...






We've arrived. There is supposed to be a rebel base here...?
I can't see here!
I'm not helping this at all...
That there is good people.
Danger close!
They're still around here... somewhere...  
Nice!
My weapon should receive it's own salary!
He looks conspicuous...
Understood. We'll take it from here.
Sector clear.
They messed up the order... This ain't exactly a fast food order!
Nobody'll miss him. What kinda backwards twisted name is Cockeye anyway?
Wild cat? Take it out!
Glad that's over. What's next?
Got 'em on the run! Let's chase 'em down!
Rest time.
Rest's over.
Agreed.
Junk.
This is trapped.
Hold up, this doesn'?t look right.
...stay calm... find your footing...  
I've arrived, what's next?

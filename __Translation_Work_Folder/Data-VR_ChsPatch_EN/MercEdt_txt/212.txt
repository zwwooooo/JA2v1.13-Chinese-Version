Whee-haw! Party time!
Finally, dude! Let's kick some ass!
Oh hell yes, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Another... uh... thing!
Now who the hell are you? You ain't from here, are ya?
Eegh! Seems like I stepped on somebody's cowpie.
There's noise, dude.
Damn! Who's burning old tires? Phew.
Yeah. Excitement. Adrenaline! Something is about to happen here.
Bloody beasts! Go play with somebody your own size - like Bigfoot.
Frickin' GD bummer, it's a beast stampede!
What's that?
There's something.
Outta ammo!
Damn, is that my left kidney over there? Aw man, no!



Ah yeah. Where was I? What was I just doin'?
Damn popgun jammed!
Frickin bullets everywhere.
Got a scratch, need a patch!
Bah! I am gonna die another day.
Like that's possible.
I'm bleedin frickin' buckets! Need a cork NOW!
I'm so damn tired I can't see the end o' my gun.
Wait a sec, I gotta catch my breath!
Eat this, mutha sucker!
Go t' hell. 
Mike? You got that frickin' psycho on your team? Screw that.



I remember some of that from Anatomy 101, but this looks frickin' awful.
It's real close in here. Can somebody open a window, please?
Got the job done. What now?
Forget it, moron!
Yeah. This would be the time for a random comment of relief. Nah. Anybody got a smoke?
Looks like some of the weird organs I saw while doing anatomy on dope back in college.
Face it. Some people are dogs. Others are trees.
Man, this sucks. I should have stayed with the doc doing funny experiments and all. 
Damn these guys are a bunch of fricked up crack heads.
Hey look a plane. Err, it looks kinda like it's lookin for us.
What's this? Did Walmart have a sale on crap or what?
These nutjobs in the team annoy me. Heh, but I'm one of them now.
Chicks should not be part of wars or maybe as a reward for the winners.
Now who is the man?
Bad idea. Real bad idea.
I did tell ya. 
Shit, what the fuck you want with Mike? He only makes trouble.




Now where's the salary check? Ahh, it just occurred to me I want cash anyway.
You shoulda paid me, sucka. I'm out.
It's kinda dark. What the heck happened to my eyes?
I can't do that.
Now that is friendly fella. Maybe he's got a sister or something?
Hey! There are suckers around. Let's get'em!
They're out there. What are they waitin' for?
Nice stuff!
Hehe, yeah!
We're lookin for that guy right?
Well then, lets see how far ya get without me.
Killed 'em all. Can we do some crazy experiments on the corpses? Please?
There's stuff missing. We got ripped off, man.
There's something about her, really, like, err, arrogance and ice.
Meow! Too bad my dobermans are back home.
Not that I was complaining or anything, but do you guys let me go for a walk now that everything's cool?
They ran away. Quite smart. I shoulda figured that too.
Tired! ... Need to sack out.
I'm up and rarin' to go.
I agree.
This sucks, I don't get it. Wait. The damn thing's broken!
I think I 'll be polite and let somebody else go through that door first.
Err, I'll  go somewhere else now, someplace more comfortable.
Oh god! The current! It's too strong!
Here and hangin'. Wake me later.

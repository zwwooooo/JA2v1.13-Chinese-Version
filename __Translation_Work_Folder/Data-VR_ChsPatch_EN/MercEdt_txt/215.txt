Freakin' jerk!
Buckle down!
I'm a pilot... not a commando.
Freakin'... uh, thing?
That's it, man! I'm not touching this stuff ever again.
What are we even doing down here, man? Let's just bomb this place from orbit.
Made a lot of noise.
My nose is itching, man!
This whole scene is making me nervous, man.
I'm not gonna go any further, man! I watch movies! Pilots always die first!
Go ahead, try to eat me, you creeps! I hope you choke!
Check it out, man.
Someone's bound to check it out, man.
Heck! I'm all out!
I'm messed up... bad... man.



Heck, man, my brain's all scrambled!
Heck! It won't shoot! Do something!
Take care of this before I blow a bowel, man...
Can't take no more than that.
Drop it already!
Check your eyes, man.
I'm leaking, man!
Need my beauty sleep, man.
Running low, man! I'm a pilot... not an athlete.
Do a head count.
Do a head count. Or, uh, antennae count?



Everyone in one piece? Man! We're lucky to still be here.
Looks like you're out of touch with the world for a while.
Heck!
That's it?
Heck... No!
Whacked, man!
Everyone in one piece? Man! We're lucky to still be here.
What a freakin' jerk!
Get it together, man.
You dudes aren't off to a very good start, man.
Everyone in one piece? Man! We're lucky to still be here.
This is some subpar equipment, man!
Understand the whole operation's covert.
Ya... think mine are frozen too, man.
Live and learn, man. Live and learn.
Buckle down!
We been down this road... haven't we, man?





Is that's the thanks I get, you freakin' jerk?
Hey, man, I guess I'm just gonna head out. No hard feelings.
Hey! These glasses are limited edition vintage aviators, you jerks!
We been down this road... haven't we, man?
How you doing?
Buckle up, man! We've got company!
Where's the eye in the sky, when you need one, huh?
That's cool, man. Real cool!
Think that was easy, man?
Check it out, man.
Is that's the thanks I get, you freakin' jerk?
Looks like we're all accounted for...
Can't say I'm looking for anything else to carry back, man.
Whacked, man!
Oh man, not again!
Man, being a part of this really made me rethink my life choices. Maybe I should adopt a cat. Or finally get that pilot license.
Dudes must have bugged out. That's cool with me, man.
Man...
How you doing?
Yeah.
I'm a pilot, not a mechanic! Have someone else take a look at that, man!
I'm not touching this, man.
Careful where you step, man!
I'm messed up...
Should be making tracks, man.

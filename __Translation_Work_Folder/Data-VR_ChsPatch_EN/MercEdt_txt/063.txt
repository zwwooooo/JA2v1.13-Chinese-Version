Target!
Enemy!
Lots o' bad guys.
Lambs approaching!
Wow! Mama!!
This stench is just funky.
Sssh! Noise.
Think I'm gonna throw up.
Maybe they are just around the corner.
Don't think we're alone.
I hate family reunions.
There!
Found it!
Trigger broke.
Looks like Old Man Death wants some company.
Gonna miss you, Raven!
A team without TNT isn't a team anymore.
Sorry for that. Could have still learned a lot from him.
Ehm, what was the order like?
Trigger is really broke.
Gettin' my ass shot off here!
I stopped running track...in High School.
Loud bug...
Shoot  what? where? How!
Gotta plug this bullet hole.
I am lying down NOW.
Uh.h.h.h.hhh.
Gotcha!
One for the good guys.
Sonnovabitch!
Go to hell!
I can rip you a new one, creep.
Top gun is now out of ammo.
Whacked, very whacked.
Yieech.
Done it.
Nope, ain't gonna do that!
Hahaha. Capped!
Yum, time for barbeque!
Something tells me I am not gonna like this guy.
Time for me to find greener pastures.
And at what street corner did you pick them up?

Bad booze...no women...dust everywhere!...Toe rot...Idiot commander!...and a bloody broken gun. God, I hate this place!
Those are real professionals.

Yah, better.
No way.

No way I am gonna work with him!
If she just had shown some appreciation.
Raven's so fine!
TNT simply is the master of his trade.
Only Eagle can do it that way!
What do you mean "No money"?!
No money..No merc! You punk!
Can't see!
Just how am I supposed to do that?
There are some nice guys around this country.
Enemies..I can smell 'em.
They're just hiding til they can whack us.
Isn't this fine.
Whoah, man..look at that!
Hey! Look at the little kid!
Bad news, really bad.
Got'em all.
What's this box stuffed with..Air?
That punk Cockeye, dumbass drunk got what he deserved.
Trophy time!
I've rarely worked with a team this good. Call me. Whenever. I'll come.
Got too hot..so they split.
Come again after some sleep.
I feel like I was reborn.
What I said!
Junk..worthless.
There's a wire stickin' out of somethin' here.
Stop! It's a trap.
Help! ...I am drowning.
We're there!

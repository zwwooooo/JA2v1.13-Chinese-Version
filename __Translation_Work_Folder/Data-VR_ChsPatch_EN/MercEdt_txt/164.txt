I've uncovered something here... 
Someone's here.
Have a target in mind?
That's it, I'm out of here.
Sorry, I just remembered, I have to go....
Look, everyone.  I don't want to wreck the excitement of being the first one in. So, really, you go in ahead of me. 
Was that who I think it was?!?
What are going to do? ...But, uh, we're smart, we'll figure something out. I'm sure of it.
Let's move along quietly, you know, so we don't attract any attention.
You wouldn't let me die, would you? 
Enough already! Won't someone help me here? 
Found something!
What's that? Over there...
Pass some ammo! 
Before I die, I have to tell you... ahhh... 



What did you say?
If you have a bright idea, now's the time to try it.
Hey, I'm getting all beat up over here.
Uck...
It was close... but I'm okay!
Might I suggest aiming that at yourself next time? 
Might I suggest healing me before I die next time? It tends to be more effective. 
*yawn* Looks like everyone could use a break. 
Uck...I'm feeling pretty bad... 
Sorry, you got in my way. 
See you around!



Not every day you get that notch on your belt.
I wouldn't want anything like that to happen to any of you
It's not safe for me.
Finished that mission! 
Nope. I know what's about to happen here
Let's walk out of here quietly. Okay? You can congratulate me later. 
Ahh, that's a relief, thank goodness that's over.
Look at him, does he look normal to you? 
I think this is a good time for someone strong and brave to lead the group. 
Ah, I just don't feel like it right now. 
I sense tremendous power.
That's more like it. 
Yeah. I've made some foolish choices when I was young. But, i can't take it back.

That's an improvement.
Um, no thanks. Maybe one the men would be interested?
No way!






Looks like we could be in for some trouble. Okay, listen. If anyone asks what we're doing here, say we're lost. Okay? 
Ouch! I can't see!
Anything would have been preferrable to this.
Now there's a guy I can look up to.
I'm ready! Let's fight! 
Oh no... someone's missing
Wow! This is, ah... nothing that important. I'll keep it.
Good thing we have our hands on this.
Well, guess what I found out? I think it's something we should take a look at!
No one slips anything past me. You sign me up, and I'll get you through anything. Trust me. 
They were no match for us. 
Imagine how well I'd do if I had all the best stuff? 
Love that finishing touch. 
I've caught something... 
now that peace has been successfully achieved...Time for me to take a well deserved bow. 
Ahh, that's a relief. 


I just said that. 
Huh, I wonder what this contraption is? 
A trap. What a nuisance. 
Got a trap!
mph! mmh! mmmpf!!!
Well, hello everyone! a new destiny? a new direction?

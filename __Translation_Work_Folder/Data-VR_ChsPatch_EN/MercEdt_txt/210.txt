Look alive.
I've been spoling for a fight.
I have a bad feeling your going to ask me to kill more.
Take it down.
Maybe I'll keep my distance.
Keep calm.
They sound like real bastards.
I already hate it.

Oh great.  Like I don't have enough problems.
I don't want one of those things anywhere near me.
Here.
Bingo.
More ammo is always useful I guess.
Ah my arm.
Tough break.
Stay with me pal.  Focus.
I just lost someone.  I'm not even thinking about that.

You gotta to be kidding.
Is that the best you can do?
<gasp>
Hey, no pressure right?
Damn it.
Over here!
I'm calling it right here.  This world can officially bite my ass.
<loosing consciousness>
Your dead.
One down.
Your such an ass.
God.  What a brat.
Hmm keep smiling jackass.
That guy was nothing.  I've had tougher challenges.
I'm no stranger to combat.
Lets not over complicate this.  Just get in there and hit him with eveything we got.
Its over.
Not the best use of my talents.
All that effort.  I would have expected more.
Target eliminated.
The first word that comes to my mind is ugly.
Theres no way things could be any worse than this.
I'm not getting mixed up in this.
This can't be good.
I have my moments.


I'm armed and ready to go.
When will you eggheads learn.

I've had enough of this.
I knew this would be a pain in the ass.
I didn't want you to have all the fun.
You've got this.
I like it.
I call bullshit.
Oh, I'm going to kill you now.  If nothing else I'll make sure you don't survive.
Er how about a little help?
Deal with it.
Follow my orders and it will be ok.
Their on to us.
Your not leaving here in one piece.
Oh looking good.
Now were talking.
Nothing is ever that easy.
Feels like things are getting worse by the day.
Good riddance.
I hope nothings wrong.
I don't really give a shit.
Kill him.
The important things are always worth fighting for.
Come face me you coward.


I think its a great idea.
This is bullshit.
Seriously?  It this some kind of joke?
Hold on.

All systems go.

You've got to be kidding.
There must be someone else you can send for whatever this is.
Get out of here and don't come back.

Not just yet.  Don't go anywhere.
This isn't working.
Your kidding right?
Why?
Nevermind.
I didn't come here to get brushed off.
Your damn right I got your back.
Alright.  Lead the way.
Erm, sure.  I guess.
Er sure. Ok.
I guess it can't hurt.
You can't be serious.
Lets see what you got.
I think you can do better than that.
Sorry I can't help you.
Not my problem.
This is pointless.
Is this really necessary?
Whatever.
Ah, could work.
I think I understand.
We've come so far.  Don't turn back now.
If theres nothing else?
Oh no.  Not again.
Erm, hi there.
If you don't like the way I'm doing things.  Get the hell out of my face.
Do you trust me?
Sounds simple enough.
Oh I'm ready.  Question is, are you?
Drop him.
On second thought. Forget it.
I don't think so.
You owe me.

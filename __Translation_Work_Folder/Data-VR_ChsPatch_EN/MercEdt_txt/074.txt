Complications!
Scouting!
I can only do so much in a time you know!
What the frigg! Get rid of this crap!
What the?
Summer sausage!
I heard small talk.
Sorry!
Don't be getting smart on me.
Frigg that! I wanna have a sandwich and relax.
I'm going home.
Mm-hh. Let me look.
Let's see!
Bad for business!
No one's blowing me out to hell.
Sorry!
Sorry!

I don't care who you are or what you're doing here!
What do you want me to do with this hunk of crap?
Woah, slow down! You got me all excited!
This hurts worse than a good spanking.
Come back later!
I miss...
I get blood all over my friggin slippers.
Talk to me tomorrow!
Frigg that! I wanna have a sandwich and relax.
Stop wasting my time!
Come back later!




Friggin war!

This is a no-brainer.
I don't care who you are or what you're doing here!
Shoot the bitch!
What a can of worms!
When I get ya, I fix ya!
This whole friggin country is completely out to lunch!
I'd give just about anything for a Tom Jones CD.

T'is crap!


I haven't got all friggin day!
My two cents!
This is a no-brainer.





Frigged me up!

What the?
Friggin waste of my time.
Come back later!
I've got work to do!
I haven't got all friggin day!
Money for that!


I don't give a crap!
As long as they pay me.
Frigged me up!
Shoot the bitch!
Summer sausage!
I don't give a crap!
Come back later!


My two cents!
This crap!
I've got work to do!
Rigged!

As soon as I can!
Computer is working. This I sure will help us.



Up here we are trapped. We must discover way to open door in basement.
There is nowhere to go. I must stay.


People of this town are poor. Like most people in countries near here.

We leave forces behind. Must go without them.
I fear attack not be secret. We make too much noise.
We are lucky... No one was left on bad side of fan.
I believe this woman has reported me to the authorities. I never stay long after buying supplies. I try never to come at same time. I do not trust her.
I have never seen this man before.
Many fear you, but not me.
This man help me before, I trust him with life.
I sure we be okay.
I sure you see much, Colonel. I hope you have more to give.
Your story is strange. It is even more than strange. I hope you are capable.
I hope it has not been too long, since you last saw real war, Mr.Tex.

It is scary when you are close to air machine.
There is nothing to fear!
Let me read letter...
I am proud. Very proud. We have destroyed it. The threat to my country is finished.

It is old weapon.
They are dead now. But it is not normal to find them here.
I would not be surprised if parts of this crazy man are in Arulco.
It is terrible that all his stuff is in parts, too.
We cannot cut it, we no have cutters. We must force it open. I am afraid there will be noise.
It is bunker door. It will not be easy to open.
I sure I hear something. Loud noise of metal. It come from bottom floor.

It is alarm. The big air machine is stopped.
It numbers to fire rockets at my country. This man was planning this, now we are sure. I think I make plan. Must be ready to leave fast. Must take elevator.
I will make rocket fire with numbers for this facility. If I right, big explosion will make whole building disappear forever. I hope buttons are simple.
There is power factory here with big air machine. It stop one time each day when alarm make noise. There is tunnel behind it. It go right to rocket facility. We could go in it. Make surprise attack on other side.
I watch everything around here, but do not know another way to facility. I guess... It possible to explode air machine, but it would make loud noise. Tell people we coming.

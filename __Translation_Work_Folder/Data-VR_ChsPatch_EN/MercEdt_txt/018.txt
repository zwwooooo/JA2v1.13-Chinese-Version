Bad dudes.
The bad dudes are here. Time for them to taste trouble.
I could use a hand here!
Gotta roach on patrol.
Check out the goon with the jaws! Man, I hope that thing stays outta my face.
I'd say the roaches been busy, man.
I sure as hell heard something.
(sniff...sniff) Let's watch our step. I think there's roach droppings around here.
Gotta stay ready for anything.
This place looks like a roach motel. They got to be around here somewhere.
Hey, dudes, I don't want to be the main course for these hungry goons.
I spotted something.
What's that over there?
Need some lead for this gun!
Don't think I'm gonna make it... If you dudes get desperate, you got my permission to eat me.
Magic, my brother, I owe you more than I can possibly tell ya. I swear I'm gonna avenge your death. I dunno how, but I'll try, man.
I'm gonna miss ya, Grizzly Bear... you were so cool under pressure. I wish I had your nerves, man. Sleep good, dude.
Blood, you were all right, dude. Your martial arts moves always blew me away, man. Save me a chair, dude.
Whoa, I zoned out. What was I in the middle of?
Aw, man, perfect time to jam.
I dunno what a smithereens is, but I'm about to be blown to 'em!
Barely felt it, dudes.
If ya bite it, Ice, who's gonna feed the dog?
We're talking missin' here, dude.
Aw, man, I'm bleedin' all over everything.
I can barely stay awake...
I'm outta breath. Shoulda never smoked.
You're history, dude.
That roach is a goner.


I got nothing against Bubba, but the way he looks at me... it's like he'd like to string me up. I know his kind, man.
Oh, man! I got Mike! Should get some sort of medal or something.
Whoa, dude... blood bath!

What's up, dude?
Don't ask me, man, 'cuz I ain't doin' it.
All right! That dude was no lady...
Yeah! Queen's been spaded, dudes.
That dipshit is full of it.
Things better shape up around here. I got one foot out the door already.
I don't know where most of these dudes get off callin' themselves Mercs. They're more like Jercs.
Bombers overhead! Gotta move our asses!
What kind of rinky-dink equipment is this? Somethin' from a blue-light special?
It'd be kinda cool if we weren't fightin' all the time, and we could just sit around and have a couple of beers and shoot the breeze.
I'm Black, so I can say it: the South Africans got chips on their shoulders a mile high and a mile wide.
On-the-job training, man!
Say, dude, I think your brains are scrambled slightly!
I coulda told you that wasn't gonna work, dude!


Way to be! Hey, they don't call him Magic for nothing!
Grizzly, you got it goin' on! Such style, dude!
You're the man, Blood!
Keep your shirt on, dude. I'll renew... maybe... once I'm ready.
It's Mike, man! This is a situation, ain't it?
Man that burns. Can't see squat.
This is a long way from happenin', dude.
He was quite the dude.
It looks like there's bad dudes in the area, man.
We got oustanding business. We haven't accounted for all the bad dudes.

That dude pissed me off!
Lookie! Lookie! It's the snot-nosed teenager dude. Should probably show him how my daddy would have taken care of things.
Well, she ain't gotta chance, dude, cuz we gonna remove her from the map. Lady's about to find out what's what.
Yeah, dude! Put another sector in the win column. Ain't nothing left breathing here.
You know, back home we break fingers for this sorta stuff, dude. It's not all here.
Shoulda done that sooner, man. He begged for it. It was the righteous thing.
Whoa, man, freaking big cat!
Yeah, we showed 'em what's what. Bet they won't forget us, but I know I won't forget them, dude. It was good hanging with ya.
Company's gone home, dude. We can turn out the lights.
I'm sacking up, dude. Be back.
Rise and shine, man. I'm on it.
I'm the same way here, dude.
Got a job for the fix-it list, dude.
Aw, man... it's set to blow.
Hang back, dudes. Looks kinda iffy around here.
Ah... man... dude... like, I'm going down... Can't do this... dude.
The trip's behind me, dude.

Look who's askin'! Not a chance, man. The grapevine says you're bad news.
No way, man. You're the Dr. Kevorkian of the merc world! Nobody survives...
No chance, dude. My new computer's coming. I gotta be here to set it up and everything. You understand that, don'tcha, man?
No can do, man. It's my anniversary, and the wife and I are goin' away for a while. You shoulda told me in advance, man. Maybe I could've juggled it around... well, not in this case, but most of the time.
This is Ice and Roberta Williams. We're not answering the phone right now. We're busy, dude. So, tell us what we can do for you, and we'll call you back!
Okay, dude, I'm hittin' the road. Have fun, keep cool.


Not a chance. I don't trust Bubba, I don't wanna work with him, and I sure as hell don't want to have to depend on him.
Hey, dude, my contract's comin' due. Time to squat or get off the pot.
Ask and ye shall receive, dude. I'm in.
All right, man. We'll give it a spin.
The hell with everything else. I want to work with Magic. I'm in.
I don't know, dude. You ain't exactly top-of-the-line, y'know? But you got Grizzly signed up, and I guess he knows what he's doing. So, I'm in.
I tell ya, dude, under other circumstances, I'd probably say no. But I think Blood's got a hell of a chance of making it big in this business, and I want to say, "I knew him when." So, I'm in.
Nope, not into it, man. Not my kinda project, not my kinda commander.
Dude, I said...
Trying to live beyond your means, dude?
Okay, you don't have to tell me twice. Just don't come crying to me later when you decide you need the Iceman again.
No way, man. You're the Dr. Kevorkian of the merc world! Nobody survives...


Not a chance. I don't trust Bubba. I don't wanna work with him, and I sure as hell don't want to have to depend on him.

Dude, I said...
Trying to live beyond your means, dude?
Yeah, this is Ice.
My motto is, "Friendly service with a smile."
This some kind of game?
Let's talk schedule. Whatcha got in mind?
Y'ever figure out what you want, call me. But don't bust my chops, I got things to do.


Well, dude, it's almost time for me to split.
Yeah, dude, figured if I'm better, my take should be, too. So, I gave my bottom line a little boost.

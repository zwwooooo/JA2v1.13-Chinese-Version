The worms.
They're crawling, the worms.
The worms are all around!
Maggots.
Rotten Maggots!
Eeeevil spirits are here.
I hear those worms.
I smell the worms.
Worms and evil demons hand in hand.
Worms are out of sight but I feel the presence of evil spirits. 
Demons all around!
Worms swarming.
There's too much worm shit here!
The evil spirit has eaten all of the bullets from my fire-stick.
Life flows out of me, spirits enjoy it. I think they are sated already.


How did it happen?!?
Well, what do you need?
The worms have damned my gun!
They want to kill me!
The bleeding has to be stopped. I don't want to be a zombie!
My spirits protect me, you worm.
The bullet won't reach the aim. 
Some evil worm will pay for it.
I'm tired already.
Spirits leave me.
VOODOO POWER!!!
Die, Maggot!




I am already hungry for brains.
If one of you gets killed, I could resurrect them. But I won't do that. Zombies stink!
Spirits are waiting.
Spirits are against it.
We're ready.
Worms are done!
Spirits don't like you.
I'll become a zombie soon, if the worms don't eat me first.
Sometimes I feel that zombies are all around me.
We are all DOOMED!
Evil spirit is in my gun.
Spirits say that you'll become a zombie soon, and I mustn't snuff out yet.
 
Spirits say that one of my characteristics is one level up!
What's the big plan now?
What's the plan?




Use Voodoo power!
Every spirit want's to be paid, now one more spirit is with me.
Spirits know everthing, spirits don't work for nothing.
Spirits will be my eyes!
Spirits say that we will miss.
You aren't a zombie, are you?
Crawl closer, worms.
Spirits say there are more worms yet to dig out!

Spirits gather power!
He's not here.
Spirits are upset.
No more worms here.
Spirits are displeased.
Evil spirit was inside him.
Demons! await.
Good luck is with me. Everybody needs some good luck.
Worms have crawled to their holes.
Don't want to work anymore, spirits feel tired. 

Spirits agree.
I SMASH YOU!
Worms have got me, and evil spirits help them. 
So what! It's time to dig out some worms!
I am invulnerable....urgh-hh.
Spirits are there already, and I'm on my way.

Where you going.
You poor bastard.
Assholes
You look like shit.
They kill on sight so lets move.
Somethings not right.
I dunno what you've heard.
Smell that?

Of course the biggest load of horse shit a man ever heard.
Were marked for death.
Good.
Alright this might help you out.
No God damn way.
I'm all torn up.




Shit.
God damn it.  I'm stuck between a rock and a son of a bitch.
Sorry newbie.
Execution needs a little work.
Good effort.
I'll survive.
I got things to deal with.
Times up.

Hurts my head just thinking about the mess.



The world would be a better place without him.
Quite a feat kid.
You know whats gotta be done right.
Good.  Alright.  Here's whats going on.
No no we can't.
They lose their power.  They die.
Violence isn't always the answer but in some cases its your God damn right.
Your risking a beat down.
Run along.
We gotta get out of here.  This is bad.
Come on move.
As I was saying.


I'm one of the only ones left that hasn't bit or switched sides.  The most veteran soldier on the battlefield.
You do what you want.  Me?  I've got things to deal with.






Freedom doesn't come cheap.
They won't be expecting an attack.

They walk tough but scare easily.  Just tear an ear off something.

Stay out of trouble kid.
The revolution ends.  We got nowhere to go.
Can't say I got out without a scratch.  Hell of a brawl though.
They'll get whats due.
Shut up.
Get lost.
I'm just a guy out of nowhere came to be involved in something five hundred times bigger than you and me.
Keep moving.

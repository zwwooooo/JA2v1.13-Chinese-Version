This is bad!
Oooh, hang on.
Who should I focus on next?
Uck ... bad case of negative energy!
May fortune smile on us in this great battle.
Oh, this has got to be a sign of bad things ahead.
I sense a living being.
I sense a creature!
I'm picking up a very bad energy here, so be careful.
It seems that our destiny awaits us below the waves. I just hope we come back to the surface again! 
I'm paralized!
Look!
What's over there?
I'm out of things to shoot.
I guess I'm fated to die...



What did you say?
Hold on a second... Blocked!
The odds are turning against me here!
Uck...
I guess the stars were in my favor.
Fate works in strange ways. Who knows...
Argh... I've got some serious injuries...
*yawn* You know, rest helps restore positive energy.
Uck... Carrying that much will seriously drain my personal energy.
Farewell
You can't avoid fate.



Not every day you get that notch on your belt.
I have a really hard time accepting that this was destined to happen.
It's not safe for me.
It was destined to be.
This just isn't destined to be.
We were destined to do it!
This should help bring peace to this planet.
I think our paths are fated to cross again ... and not peacefully.
Uck... I don't feel right.
I forsee bad things coming out of this alliance....
I sense tremendous power.
That's an improvement.
Yeah. I've made some foolish choices when I was young. But, i can't take it back.

That's an improvement.
Um, no thanks. Maybe one the men would be interested?
No way!






Wait, I sense something...Many people lost their lives here, long ago. But how? Oh, I see now. Look at that wall!
Everything's as dark as midnight!
It's just not destined to happen.
I feel a strong positive energy from him.
Let's attack - now is the time!
That's it, someone's missing!
Wow
Good thing we have our hands on this.
How strange that fate would make our path cross with his.
Thanks, i guess destiny has some nasty things in store for all of us.
Fortune was with us!
Something's wrong with the energy flow....
I'm just glad that's over.
This is bad!
Fate works in strange ways. Who knows, perhaps this is all part of some bigger plan? Come on, let's go find out where Destiny is going to lead us.
They got away, thanks the stars.


We're in conjunction on that one.
I guess things are a lot more complicated than I imagined. 
I have a bad feeling about this trap!
I'm picking up some strange energy... Something's hidden here!
mph! mmh! mmmpf!!!
I guess I'm destined to stay here a while longer.

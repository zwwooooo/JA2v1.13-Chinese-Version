Traitors!
Have action here!
This is dilemma!
Borscht!
Christ in Kremlin! Now I face them! Can this be real?
Had I been here, I would not have let this happen.
A noise! A suspicious noise.
Grandma's borscht? No, it cannot be.
I anticipate danger. I am ready.
Trouble is near... I know it.
I do not know fear.
I find something.
Interesting...
I need reload!
Ah... my name is spelled P-A-L-K-O-V, and I am diabetic in case doctor... must know.
Poor Ivan, mother Russia was better for you. You did her proud. I will fight this day for your honor.


Ah, a bad memory. I lost my concentration.
My weapon is not functioning.
They are just trying to scare me without success.
In Russia, we call that foreplay.
I felt a breeze.
I cannot see it from here.
I am shedding my blood!
I am requiring a sleep.
Urgent, let me catch my breath.
I win this one!
The monster is mash potatoes.


Why make me work with an idiot like Fidel! He is no good, and I wish him to be removed from my presence.
All right you fool, you have made your decision. Fidel stays, I go.
Inside I am warm and fuzzy.

Job complete. Next?
I do not feel it necessary.
So we meet again, Deidranna, and all too fitting that it would be me to bring you to your death. You may have hired me, but in good conscience, I could not continue.
Die, you mother of borscht!
What an imbicile.
Should have shot Deidranna when I had chance. But, no, and look now what we must go through.
I see women here carry guns. Women should carry baby. Is pitiful what this war has done.
Overhead!
Junk! A soldier of my quality should have better equipment. Clearly, this is obvious to everyone.


I am improving.
Think this slower. I think you go too fast for self.
Drunk like skunk, I would not have done that.


Ivan, you are the pride of Mother Russia.


Perhaps there is an error in processing? I do not see pay yet.
Ungrateful infidels! Many would pay dearly for my service, so I shall seek them out instead.
Aghh! It is with much pain that I cannot see!
My opinion is, it is not possible.
You are kind.
Traitors in the area!
We must remain on guard. The traitors are still near.

The party is over!
The teen boy! I will give him stern lecture.
Most unexpected. I had changed allegiance for you, and this what I get? Most unexpected.
All traitors lay in their blood without movement.
We are not the first to open this... Others have made claim to our things.
Good. We kill traitors together.
Siberia!
For this opportunity, for this success, I owe you congratulations and praise.
The traitors have moved out of territory.
It is urgent that I sleep.
I am presently working.
Me too!
I am tiring of this junk equipment.
Oooh... it is dangerous!
There lies traces of danger.
Ur...gent... the currents... they... pull... me... un 
My arrival has happened.

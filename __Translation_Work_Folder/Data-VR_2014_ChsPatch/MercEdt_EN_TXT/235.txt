I need shells... And don't be cheap with 'em!

Damn! My gun won't fire!
I'm bored...
What's the chance that it isn't hurts?
Somebody's gonna pay for that.
I'm not cut out for this sort of crap!
Need stitching...
A shot of water would help.
Give me a break...
There's another notch on my gun.

You're going express to the big loony farm in the sky , Skitzy.


I've killed people for less! Much less!


You can depend on me.
The next time you do that, you'd better show more commitment!
We're running this place now!
There's another notch on my gun.

I'm bored! Bored out of my flippin' mind.
I plan on being the last person you see in your short miserable life!
Make the necessary arrangements!
Give me a break... This thing's defective!


Well... 
Give me a break... Do you have any idea what you're doing?

How special! I found the mental illness poster boy!




We're getting tight on time.
This is gonna be wild!

In a minute... I ain't finished yet!

I'm going to suck every last ounce of blood out of you.
They won't be bothering us anymore.

I've killed people for less! Much less!


This sector is OURS!

Can't... catch my breath! Unable to swim... Anymore!
We got what we came for!

I was on your team. I got bored... The place had about as much action as a morgue without bodies.
Must be a couple of big ones going down, everbody's getting work. I want to see what else comes my way before I say yes.

Give me a break... I'm on vacation!
I'm outta here! What a disappointment! I could have put at least a dozen more notches on my gun on any other assignment!
Skitz Bonner is fried, I gotta do something about him. It's time to clean the gene pool...


Give me a break! Ya paid through the nose!
Let's do it, big spender!
Ya... I'll sign on!



I'm outta here... There ain't nowhere around here to spend this kind of money!
I thought I was clear when I said...
Give me a break... Is daddy gonna mail you the money?
If you'd remember how I left, you'd know I wasn't coming back!
I'm not ready to get back into the grind just yet!

Shooting clay pigeons was all right, but shooting people is a whole lot more fun and I think it's the screaming.
I give you my word... I don't let too many of them get away.
Give me a break... Do you have any idea what you're doing?
I've got more than just your offer to think about. The deal clincher is going to be the amount of signing money you're offering.



Thanks for the offer, but I won't be taking it.
Your offer has been matched. You'll have to do better if you're still looking to hire me.

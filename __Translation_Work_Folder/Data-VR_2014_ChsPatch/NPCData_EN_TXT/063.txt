I'm Cobra, as in the 427, not the snake.
I've seen you before.
I'm in a bit of trouble.
As I said, I'd rather keep moving.
I don't need that!
You help me, I'll help you.
Shit!! Keep it up and you get a fist sandwich for that mouth.
No. Too simple.
Hurtin' here...a lot!
Gotta go.
Bleeding stopped. Thanks!
Damned son of a bitch!
Okay, that's good for me. I got wheels and gas. Hop in!
I hot wired this jeep at a military base, but borders are closed. I wanted a big H&B truck to go off road, but they have a fancy electronic immobiliser.
I've been a soldier, too. I worked for..uh..various people.
Yeah, let's rock!
No, come on, that's not right! Whatever, maybe you'll change your mind.
I've got money due, bub. Pay up!
Good. Thanks.
We talk when the idiots stop with the gunfire, okay?

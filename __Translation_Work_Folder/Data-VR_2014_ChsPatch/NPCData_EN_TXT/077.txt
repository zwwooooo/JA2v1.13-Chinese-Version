I feel relieved. Yes, I'm Enrico Chivaldori.
Hello my friend! Do you have news?
Oh thank you! Thank you very much, that you untangled us.
And we maybe can help you...?!
I do not need that!
Artillery and aircraft can be used again!
You shouldn't put it that way, hmm?
It's a remote possibility...but not yet!
Don't let me dying! Help me!
You have much to do.
Thank you very much, my friend.
Cabr√≥n! You TRAITOR!!!
End the battle, I'm scared!
If I could help you, I would do it with pleasure.
You met Ricardo? Did he know anything about the action capabilities of our troops?
Doesn't sound good. But we can alert the air force and artillery.
With the information we have, we consider that there is a former double of her in power.
She could disappear. Later she was set to the throne by Richard Chainlie and Joe Papanus. The false officers of the army were also involved!
Anyway, those officers do not know who she really is.
They only trust her. If you could kill the double, the loyalty of the army will break down, immediately.
I think, it's time to act NOW!
You think we should give them our Missiles, Tyra?
No, I don't need that.

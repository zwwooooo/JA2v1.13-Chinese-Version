Hello.
We meet again. How nice.
I understand the necessity of war. But it just seems this whole thing could have been settled... with an assassination.
You're the hired guns I've heard of. I have a lot of respect for your line of work.
I don't want it.
I came down here to get away from it all. Finding myself in the middle of a war makes me nervous as hell. The Americans will come. They always come to a war! I don't like the Americans.
In case you hadn't noticed, I have a gun. Perhaps we can talk like professionals here.
No. Wasn't part of my plans.
I need a doctor...
Good talking to you.
Appreciated.
You should have backed out when you had the chance!
Stop! Okay, you know who I am. We can make a deal. How would you like to have the use of my talents? I'm an excellent sniper. Very comfortable on rooftops. Can pick off just about anything you want.
I tell you what... I'll give you a week. You get the services of Richard Ruttwen, free of charge, for one week. Then, we're even, and I walk. If you know anything about my reputation, you won't pass on the chance.
Okay... We got a deal. Just treat me like any of the others.
You deceitful bastard!
Don't be expecting me to do anything for it.
Still a lot of fighting going on here. Not a good time to be talking.

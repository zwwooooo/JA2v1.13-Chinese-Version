You got that right, I'm Sandman, Sparky's son.
Ah, there you are again. I still have the time and the will to join your team.
The mercenary profession in our family is a tradition.
I'm on holidays at the moment. I'm thinking that some practical experience can't be too bad.
Nope, I'm not wanting that, thanks.
There's nobody more evil than Deidranna.
Don't say that again buddy, you could regret it!
Are you insane? I'm not joining a suicide squad!
I'm bleeding. Do you have a med kit?
I'm Sorry! I don't have time to talk to you right now.
Hmm... somethin' else?
I'll kill you for that!
I'm going to be an elite mercenary too. I've studied the business for years, even visited some of the folks training at A.I.M. sometimes.
My teachers in school always said I'm quite smart...when I was there. I have magical hands as well and can make stuff disappear.
Gimme a sec to just pack my kit, then we're ready to roll.
I'm gonna be a famous mercenary.
This country's perfect for learning how to fight.
There's rebels, civil war and such.

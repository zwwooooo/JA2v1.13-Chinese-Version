Hey, the A.I.M. guys! Good to see you.
Well, have you decided otherwise?
You want to assassinate Deidranna? Oh yeah, I'd love to help you with that!
Don't you need a chemist?
What am I supposed to do with this?!
Well... I'm ready.
Haha, do you think you're scaring me?
Hey, yo, will it take any longer?
Hey maan, I'm injured, can anyone come and bandage me?
Well... I'm ready.
Well... I'm ready.
G'day, d'you want to buy anything?
If I want to come with you? Of course, I'd love it!
Hey, yo, will it take ANY longer?
Hm, I don't have that much money on me. Come back later.

You certainly want to get to the weapon facility in Doran. That's the biggest facility in the whole country.
Nope, I'm only interested in things which go "BOOM!" my friend.
Did you hear of Eagle, yet? He's still standing guard on the old reservoir dam, although this thing is almost falling apart meanwhile.
This dude is so suicidal! The soldiers standing around him only need one grenade to make the whole dam collapse.
Cool thing!
Hey, yo, will it take any longer?
Very good choice! Next time I'll bring more trade.
Yep, I can use that.
Very good choice! Next time I'll bring more trade.
Hey, yo, will it take any longer?
You've forget something here or shall I keep that?!
Okay, suit yourself!
Yeah, see ya!
You certainly want to get to the weapon facility in Doran. That's the biggest facility in the whole country.
I've been in there, yet. I could be of use to you.
If I want to come with you? Of course, I'd love it!
I believe I could be useful.
Hm, I'm not taking it the wrong way. I can still supply you with the explosives you need.
You can't count on me until you've paid your dues.
Ahh, how encouraging!
Kill all those weirdos around me first!

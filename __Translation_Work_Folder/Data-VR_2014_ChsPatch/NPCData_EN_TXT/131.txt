Hey, up to here and not a step further!
Nobody gets in or out!
I am doing what I was paid for, and I was paid to guard this door, do you understand?
A conscience... ethics? Don't give me this crap! My conscience needs one thing - to get paid!
What am I supposed to do with this crap?
You want to be a mercenary too? So tell me, who am I supposed to be then? The nice uncle who is going to tell you a good night story perhaps?
You seem to be a bit nervous. Do you have money problems?
And play the noble savior like you? Forget it!
I need a doctor comrade or better a nurse!
I've got a job to do!
Thanks!
Now you'll die!
Seems to be your lucky day. I didn't get paid for entering this combat.

You are still not getting it, are you? Once again for the slow ones, and open your ears: No access for unauthorized personnel!
Oh man, stop nagging into my ear, I don't get paid for this!
Don't forget what I told you!
Nobody has access to the prisoners!
Don't get your hopes up! You are talking to a complete stranger!
I'll let it slide just this once, out of respect for our profession. You won't get a second chance, are we clear?!
Hey, if this was a computer game, you should have saved earlier you asshole!
Ah, I see, we are slowly starting to understand each other...
However just reaaally slooowly...
What's up with you? You know the profession, and you want to give me pocket change?
Very well! A number with many zeros at the end, just like I pictured it!
Wow, looks like I underestimated you. It appears you are a true professional.
And as such, you understand this conversation never happened. Otherwise you are going to see me soon again!
I take it of course, but don't expect anything.

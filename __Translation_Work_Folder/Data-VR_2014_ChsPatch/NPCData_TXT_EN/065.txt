Wassup, you hear to help out? Before shit hit the fan I was keeping homes in power and regulated the electricity, but I aint heard jack since the supervisor was shot dead and now the bombs are dropping! Is it safe to go out?
I dunno man, should I go with you guys and have me some righteous payback? Folks back home are gonna read about the shit I'm gonna do to that Queen's ass!
Yeah, this engineering is a tough job, especially in Arulco, paying me good paper too, but not good enough to be dealing with bombs n shit!
The dam got heavily damaged since the Traconian artillery started shelling us and shit. People started leaving in droves and then others wound up dead on the highway outta here. I want outta this!
What the hell you want me to do with this?!  It aint gonna change a damn thing! This whole plant is fucked up!
Once a rocket crashed right into the side of the dam, took out one of my boyz. We heard later they were trying to hit the army base to the west, short-sighted motherfuckers!
Stay outta my face fool, I've been through enough already! You want me to flip you the fuck over! Huh? And stomp your mouth? You wanna carry on with the stress, I'll get my gat out and nonsense will cease!
Nah man. Wasn't part of my plans.
I need a doctor, get me a doctor!
What's goin on? You got news? I aint heard shit.
Hey man, I can use this one, thank you very much indeed!
You should have backed out when you had the chance, fool!
Aight, I see it now, there's nothin I can do for this place no more.
And how would it be, if I hooked up with you guys? I got skills, good with ma hands too, aint nuthin holdin me back now.
Alright... good to be rollin withcya. Just treat me like any of the others and we won't have a problem.
You chump-change motherfucker!
Yeah, but don't you be hollerin to me about doing anything for it.
Shit man! Bullets are flying around and you wanna be talkin!?! You must be crazy!

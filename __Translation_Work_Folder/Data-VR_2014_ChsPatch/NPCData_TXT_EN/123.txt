Hello, I'm Jaime Suarez.
Nice to see you again.
Good, with the soldiers gone, I can work on my dam.
I've got something that could help you. I'll give it to you, if you give me the tools I need.
No thank you. I need tools!
Ahh, don't get on my nerves!
Okey! Now here, I found it on the body of a drowned soldier.
Seems to be coordinates or something...
Nobody talks to me this way! Not on my dam!
Anythin' else?
I cannot leave the dam unsupervised!
Keep the shooting away from my dam!
Calm down friend! If you help me I'll help you...
Argh!...I could use some bandage.
Ahh.....Much better!

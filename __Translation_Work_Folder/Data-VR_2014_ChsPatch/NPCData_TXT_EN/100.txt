I'm Natsuko. I'm a reporter for a magazine from Tokyo.
Ah, there are you again.
Arulco is big news in the press.
Maybe I could cross the borders more easily if we're not being seen together that often.
No, thanks, I can't take this kind of stuff.
You could help me out... come in handy...
What do you want from me? Everybody is so damn aggressive around here, just like those guards in Tixa.
You've got my blessing, but I can't come with you.
Ah! I'm losing so much blood, is everywhere!!! Help me!
If you'll excuse me, I have to do research for a news story.
Ah..., thanks! You want to bestow presents on a beautiful woman, huh?
Why are you doing this? Please don't!

Thank you! How did you manage to take this from the coarse guy? On the other hand, I don't really want to know.
Here, take my camera. I can't keep it after all, and I can't take it across the border.



This tape contains an important information, it's the only reason why I'm still here.

Ahh! It's so dangerous around here. Go away!
Arigatou, I will take it care of this.

I had a big story. But then they took away the tape.
On this tape are important information. That's the reason why I'm here.
If you could bring it to me...?

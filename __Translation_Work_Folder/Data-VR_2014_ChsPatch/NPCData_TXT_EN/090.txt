You need to leave.
You of all people.  Get out!
Hey hands off.
Get away from me.
I don't think there is a need for that.
This is the last time I say it.  Get out.
Stay away from me.
Nah I don't think so.
You could have just asked.
What? No.
Have I done something to make you bother me?
Ok ok.  You've talked me into it.
Please mister.  You got to get me out of here.
Please.  Da can barely walk on that leg now.
I knew it. I knew my father was a hero but my mothers dead.  Hope this war last long enough that I get to fight in it.
Yes papa.
Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war.
Well I just have to think of something else then.
That doesn't change anything.
Help me! Help me!
Oh no you don't.
No need to get rough.

Outsiders!
Spotted!
I got all I can handle.
Huge hideous bugs!
One of these creature things again!

Somebody!

Kinda quiet around here?


There are probably others who need it more.
Down there!
Hate to say it.
It appears we're nearing the end!




Nothing happened!
Stress!
Prevent that from happening again!
Thank God!
For real?
Get me a doctor!
My men have been through an extremely rough time.
Drop off.
Not all bad.





The war!

I'm prepared to continue.
That'll be up to you!
Finally!
Kinda crazy!
That's really no way to talk to somebody.
Things could be going better.
I miss the responsibility the job gave me.

Wasn't always like this.
A lot of the men are scared.

I knew what I did.









I'm still having problems!
Could be a matter of days!
Nice to see a friendly face!
Full capacity!
We will remain cautious!
My appreciation.


I don't understand!
Liberated!
Punish them.
Cruelty!
Those creatures!
The answer to all our prayers.
It's how they stay alive.


You name it!
No way!
Scared.
I'm prepared.

Here to stay!
Computer is working. This I sure will help us.



Up here we are trapped. We must discover way to open door in basement.
There is nowhere to go. I must stay.


People of this town are poor. Like most people in countries near here.

We leave forces behind. Must go without them.
I fear attack not be secret. We make too much noise.
We are lucky... No one was left on bad side of fan.
I believe this woman has reported me to the authorities. I never stay long after buying supplies. I try never to come at same time. I do not trust her.
I have never seen this man before.
Many fear you, but not me.
This man help me before, I trust him with life.
I sure we be okay.
I sure you see much, Colonel. I hope you have more to give.
Your story is strange. It is even more than strange. I hope you are capable.
I hope it has not been too long, since you last saw real war, Mr.Tex.

It is scary when you are close to air machine.
There is nothing to fear!
Let me read letter...
I am proud. Very proud. We have destroyed it. The threat to my country is finished.

It is old weapon.
They are dead now. But it is not normal to find them here.
I would not be surprised if parts of this crazy man are in Arulco.
It is terrible that all his stuff is in parts, too.
We cannot cut it, we no have cutters. We must force it open. I am afraid there will be noise.
It is bunker door. It will not be easy to open.
I sure I hear something. Loud noise of metal. It come from bottom floor.

It is alarm. The big air machine is stopped.
It numbers to fire rockets at my country. This man was planning this, now we are sure. I think I make plan. Must be ready to leave fast. Must take elevator.
I will make rocket fire with numbers for this facility. If I right, big explosion will make whole building disappear forever. I hope buttons are simple.
There is power factory here with big air machine. It stop one time each day when alarm make noise. There is tunnel behind it. It go right to rocket facility. We could go in it. Make surprise attack on other side.
I watch everything around here, but do not know another way to facility. I guess... It possible to explode air machine, but it would make loud noise. Tell people we coming.

Snapperheads.
Our guests are here.
This is when I'm at my best.
Need a broom!
Bet that'd make a crunch if you stepped on it, man.
Roaches got some appetite.
Hush up! Heard something.
Hoo-wee... haven't smelled nuthin' that bad since the days I shared a room with my sister, man.
Bring it on. I want to kick some ass.
Roach zone. Take your spray cans off safety.
This ain't nuthin', man. My aunt had a couple of these behind her freezer.
Over there.
Got something.
Chamber's empty, man.
Pissin' blood, man!
Blood bit it? Big time downer, man.
If Ice is dead, hell musta froze over.

Brain fart! Lost it, man...What was happenin'?
Piece is screwed!
Your ass is on my platter, snapperhead!
Trying to impress me?
I don't sweat the close ones.
How am I supposed to hit that, man?
Got a skin puncture, man.
Couple of big Z's do me some good.
I need to chill.
So long, Snapperhead!
End of the road, roach.
That uppity bitch grates me, man... Keep Buns outta my hair.

Bubba's a racist good ol' boy. Keep him close to me, and you'll be pulling him out of a tree.
Here's a family name for him--Mike Gonnabecoldsoon!
It'd be cool if there was a replay or something. Kinda like to see it again in slow-mo, like a couple of times, man.

I'm through here.
No flippin' way, man.
The bitch is dead!
Mama roach is history!
Got a real winner here.
Not saying things are boring or anything, but just how many shopping days are there 'til Christmas, man?
What a bag of misfits I find myself in, man.
We got bad birds headed our way.
This is training school crap I'm getting, man.
What is it with these people, man...snapperheads, every last one of them.
Don't ask me why, but the Danish just piss me off.
I'm in tune.
There's a cokehead idea.
Could have taken bets on that.
Why did you bring that stuck-up Buns Sonderguard down here? I know just what she needs! You'd better get her away from me!

You be blood, Blood!
The Iceman breaks through, again.

Chill. We'll talk soon.
That hotshot Mike took a job with 'em. He's gonna pay just like the others.
Burnin', man. I'm like seeing nuthin'.
I'm spinnin' my wheels, man.
That was one of the few people I met down here that wasn't a snapperhead.
Snapperhead alert! Hope everyone got the message!
We got strays. Might circle back on us.

Ya gotta like that!
I should have known we'd run into that kid here. This is where I'd hangout.
Thanks, man. You chill, and let me go throw a little party for them snapperheads. Already got their presents picked out. Engraved the stones and everything.
Every last one of them. Checked out permanently!
I think someone's done their shopping in our box, man.
One snapperhead less.
Think of the litterbox, man.
Time to chill out and relax. No more snapperheads breathing down our necks. You need me again, man, it'd be a pleasure. Here, take my beeper number, but don't let it out.
They must have headed to a snapperhead party in another sector.
I need to catch some "z's". Like now.
Magic's back on the job.
Count me in.
This isn't working, man.
Hold up. This thing's got a surprise.
Watch your ass, man. Things don't look right around here.
Hey, man, my ass... is draggin' bottom here...
Like lightnin', man. I'm here and ready to strike.

Not gonna happen! I can afford to be picky, man... And I ain't picking someone with your pathetic record.
You gotta be nuts! Place is like cadaver-central. Look elsewhere!
It don't look good, man. I'm booked up solid.
Not possible, man. Got to get back and take care of a few things. Ya shouldn't leave this kinda stuff to the last second.
Magic ain't here right now. You know what to do, so do it.
I thought I could drag this out a bit... guess not. That's cool.
As long as that chick Buns is part and parcel of the scenery, you can forget about me being at the party.

Bubba is a bubblehead, man. A white bread, snapperhead! I ain't gonna be in the team photo. As long as he's in Arulco, don't look for me.
We got business. You extending, or what?
We gonna be seeing some more of each other.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
I got a couple of problems working with ya, but having Blood on your team is gonna put 'em aside for now.
Ya signed the Iceman, ya signed me.

The whole episode was a deep downer, man... Maybe after a couple days of Prozac, we can talk... but don't count on it.
Melt the wax! I told ya...
We got a problem. No... you got a problem. Ya might want to do business with that half-assed MERC outfit. Hear you don't need money to hire those clowns.
Shoot, man! I just got my bags unpacked.

Magic.
When I work for you, I'm all there, man. Stuff gets done.
What's the deal? Ya on another line or what?
I can cut you some slack on a long-term deal, if it's good for you.
Whatcha think? Your face is worth staring at? I got a TV, man... think I'll go see what's on. Later!
I'll go, only because it's a big country. But ya keep that Danish prune, Buns Sonderguard, outta my face.

Our deal is closing up, man.
I go up, man, and so do the dollars. You know what I'm saying? Show me the money.

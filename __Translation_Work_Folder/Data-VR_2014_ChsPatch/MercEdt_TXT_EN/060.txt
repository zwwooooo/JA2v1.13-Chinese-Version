Ah! Enemies!
There's something to do here!
This is going to be tight.
Woah, what a mutated pile of metal!
Oh boy! This is looking like trouble.
Ah, it smells in here like a sewer.
There is someone! Close by.
Ugh! It smells like dead rat in here.
They probably lurk behind the next corner.
I believe the robots are not far.
Ah man, I need a can opener, quick!
Hmmm, look here...
Hm Hmm, what do we have here?
Agh, I need some supplies!
*Coff coff* They got me....bad.
Fidel, Fidel!!! ...You were one of a kind. Rest in peace, my friend.
These assholes killed TNT, for that, I'll finish 'em all!
Too bad Fox, that we didn't get a chance to get to know to one another more. The time with you was really great.
What do you want me to do?
Damn it! The weapon is stuck!
Grrrr! Let's get it on!
Oh man, I think it's time to beat it.
Ha ha! This guy needs some glasses.
No way! I am never going to hit this!
I am bleeding! Anyone have a band aid?
*Yawn* It's time for bed, I think.
*Uff* I need a breather!
This one won't get up anymore.
Looks like this thing has had a major short circuit.




Ah ha ha! Don't lose your head!

I'm done. What should I do now?
Dream on! Look for someone else for this crap!
Well, this is the end of her tyranny.
We solved this problem once and for all.
What an asshole!
Working on this team doesn't bode well for my health.
Ha! Where did you find these jokers? The loony bin?

The best I can do with this thing is to throw it at the enemies. It's not much good for anything else.
These team members are all rookies. There's a lot they need to learn.

Ha! I learned something!
No, no, no, I can't do this!



Fidel has it going!
Ah TNT is the best, man.
Ha! Yo Fox! You showed 'em.


Agh! I can't see a thing!
Man! This is not going to work!
You still can meet nice people in this land.
We are not alone!
Be careful! There's a couple rascals running around here.
This piece is sweet!
This weapon has a decent kick!
Ah, there he is! There's the escapee!
Okay then. Farewell.
Ha haaa! This sector is ours!
There's something bloody well missing here.
They just didn't want to get it.
Come here Kitty kitty kitty...
Deidranna has been taken care of and the land is free. Arulco can look forward to a hopeful future.
Ha! They're outta here! Those cowards split.
Now way! First I need some sleep.
Fresh to work!
Just wanted to say the same.
Ah, she's fucked!
Hmmm... Looks suspicious!
I don't like the look of this!
Help! I am drowning!
What do you need done?

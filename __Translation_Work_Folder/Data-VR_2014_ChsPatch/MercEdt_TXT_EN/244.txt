Found one! I wanna fry this sucker!
I wanna fry this sucker before I'm spotted.
I'm having it out with some unfriendlies over here!
Found one!
I wanna fry this sucker before I'm spotted.
If you were doing things right, there wouldn't be so many bodies!
Huh?
Can taste the danger in the air! Let's be extremely careful around here.
I don't like this! Everything's quiet. Soon I'll feel a short twinge between my shoulders and cold blood will start dripping down my back.
Call the networks! I found the missing link!
I'm in contact with a few!
Found something.
I'll take care of it.
Need ammo! I've been caught short!
Can't... seem to move my legs. Need aid... now.



I'm slightly disoriented.
It's jammed. I can't believe this, my gun is jammed!
I'm caught in shell storm!
Just take a deep breath...
Extremely close!
I question whether even a sharp-shooter could make that.
I need bandaging.
I'm pooped!
Then again - maybe I won't.
You asked for it!
You asked for it!
Goodman's a slob! He's a pig's pig. If you don't get rid of "It", I'm looking for a more civilized outfit.


You cold-blooded, spineless wimp.
We apologize for the damage!
I'm pooped.
Everything went the way we wanted it to.
Nonsense!
I'd say we've earned our pay.
I can't wait to get out of here.
I don't see any more point in talking.
Team spirit has hit an all-time low, and the way you shuffle us around it's no wonder.
You aren't the type of employer I wanna work for more than once.
This isn't good!
This thing have seemed better days.
They're doing the PBS special on the Watergate break-in! I hear they want to interview me. Heck! They could make me a star!
You know, not only did I served more time than anyone else involved in Watergate break-in, I served more time than all of them put together.
I'm hoping to be hearing from a few people.
Get your act together!
Like always, everything I've been hoping for - falls through.
Goodman is a creature. I don't even think he's human. When you get rid of "It", you give me a buzz.




I've seen enough! Have you ever actually paid anyone?
He should be put down like a dog.
This isn't good!
I ain't making any progress!
No problem. It wasn't your fault.
It's simply a question of time!
Come on out, so we can get this over with!

Money can't buy you everything.
I'll take care of it.
This is crazy! I couldn't possibly have done anything to get fired!
We're in control here!
You'd have to be crazy to pay what you did!
You asked for it!
Found one!
It was good. If I fit into your plans again, you look me up!
That's one less team to contend with.
I could use some sun, sand and surf.
Those guys from PBS are supposed to be calling any minute. I don't wanna miss out.
Didn't you hear me?
This thing have seemed better days.
It's got one wire too many.
Let's pay special attention to where we walk around here.
I... I can't believe! I'm drowning!
Everything appears to be in order.

Bogie in range! My location unknown to him!
Multiple bogies present!

Bogie sighted!
What are you?
Bogie sighted!
Watch for anything jutting out of the ground!
It goes against my grain, but...
Multiple bogies present!
Something here!
Something here!
Need to be resupplied with ammunition.
I'm in dire need of...of medical attention. I... I'm unable to move!
With Bud's passing, the military community has suffered an undeniable loss.



My gun has jammed!
Being fired at!
Blood is flowing out of my wounds.
You can be court-martialed for that, soldier!
I wish it was possible.
Request assistance!
I'm wiped!
I'm wiped!
Sign em out!
Sign em out!
I'd drop the gaffer in a minute. Sam Garver's been a thorn in my side for years.


An overwhelming success!
A godsend...
You won't be commanding me, Commander.
Objective accomplished!
I respectfully refuse.
An overwhelming success!
An overwhelming success!
This is going nowhere fast!
If I was working for you, soldier, I'd be A.-FRIGGIN'-W.O.L.
Where were you assigned before soldier? The motor pool?
You're nowhere close to snuff, soldier!
Not while in uniform, soldier!
I bet you weren't good at competitive sports as a child.

Primo performance, soldier!
Tactical error.
Tactical error.
It's that stick-in-the-mud Garver!

I've always gotten along really well with Bud... 


It might be best to remember you're not the only job on the block.
Bogie sighted!
Taking heat!
Unfortunately, it looks easier than it is!
It seems I might have been too quick to judge you...
Let's get to it!
It's an affirmative, Commander! Let's get down to it!

Sign em out!

We only have a short time remaining.
Pleased to report a change in sector status. This one is ours now!

An overwhelming success!
A godsend...
This is definitely one of my proudest victories!
We downed that entire squad!
I'm wiped!
Let's get to it!
Maybe we should just pack up and go home.
This is no longer functional.
Boobytrap! I think I can disable it.
Beware! Things don't look right around here!
Can't keep my he...ad above water... much longer!
We're at a turning point, soldier. It's time to bring it on home.

Not right now! Give me some time to run a background check on you.
Your offer doesn't appeal to me! You've had some trouble the past couple of days. I've got no time for losers!
Get the cash together and come back and see me.
That's it for me. You don't appear to be interested in accomplishing objectives!
As of yet, no one has returned my calls. As soon as I can gather some detailed info on you, I'll listen to your offer.
The bonuses are even, we'll have to try one more time, Commander.
I don't work with Sam Garver... And I never will! Fire him, or I quit!


I can't say I'm not disappointed, however the length of the assignment was adequate, and rotation is part and parcel of this business.
It'd be great to work for you, Commander.
I'm in your squad, Commander!
Although I have my doubts about you, Lieutenant Bud Hellar is an exemplary soldier and a gentleman. It would be privilege to serve with him.


I have to leave, I've been subpoenaed to testify before your war crimes tribunal. I still find it hard to believe that so many of your men have died!
I repeat...
Get the cash together and come back and see me.
I got pressing business to attend to. I have to leave.
Forget it! Your butt's on the line! We're talking war crimes! We're talking far too many men leaving their hopes and dreams on your battlefield, BUDDY!
Not as long as you've got that old fart, Sam Garver, working for you. I can't stand him!


Bud Hellar was willing to put it all on the line for you.


I repeat...
Get the cash together and come back and see me.
I know I can fulfill your needs, Commander. How many other Captains did you notice in the lineup?
Ya, sure I will! And Saddam wants to be an American some day!
Yep... I've been up to seven Gees. Which sounds impressive until you've seen Lt. Commander Iggy Turner suck on a Marlboro at six.
You've acquired excellent value for the buck, Commander.
I'm not in a position to accept your proposal at face value. I have variety of offers, Commander, and I'm asking all potentials for a signing bonus.


And, in case you've forgotten, I've already bargained my way around the block with you, Commander. And we won't be doing it again!
You will mention in my file that I was let go for purely economic reasons!

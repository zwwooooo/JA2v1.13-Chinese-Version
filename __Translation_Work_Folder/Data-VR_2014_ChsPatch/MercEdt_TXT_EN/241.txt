Found a target!
This is gonna be easy! The dimwit doesn't see me!
I've got trouble here!
Found a target!
Found a target!
Damn!
Got to stay cautious.
Damn!
I never wear undergarments on the battlefield. It keeps me cautious!
Got to stay cautious. Don't want to mess it up now!
I'm having some troubles!
There's something here.
There's something here.
My gun is out of ammo!
I think I'm in serious trouble! I can't feel my feet...




What a time for my gun to jam!
Got lead flying in my direction!
I have blood dripping down my leg.
That was a close call...
I should wait for a better opportunity.
I have blood dripping down my leg.
The conditions weren't ideal
If I keep up this pace, I'm going to pass out.
That's the way it's done!
That's the way it's done!
I can't stand that Weasel Augustin!


That's the way it's done!
Violence... It's just not for everyone.
DAMN!
Everything's done. I'm on the clock.
It's gonna hurt me to do it...
That's the way it's done!
That's the way it's done!

Is it true that your team is selling cookies?
You're a mercenary's dream. Low risk and a full day's pay!
Are you waiting for reinforcements?
This thing isn't even working!


I'm glad I'm working for you!
Some deal, he milked you like a cow!
Just what the hell are you looking for?
It's goddamn Weasel!




Time is working against us.
I've got trouble here!

This type of stuff ain't exactly my strong point.

I wouldn't be shocked if there were mines around here.
Maybe they got scared and left.
Nice!
Looks like you bought us the bargain of the century!

Well... You're hanging tough! Make 'em eat their words this time around.
You can kiss those guys goodbye!
You get to insult me once...and you've done it.
Be sure to write!
I've got trouble here!
Money's nice, but coming out on top is even better!
Maybe they got scared and left.
If I keep up this pace, I'm going to pass out.
What a loudmouth... I'm glad I'm working for you!
You're in the ballpark, but you're in the cheap seats!
This thing isn't even working!
It's a boobytrap... Not much of one... I should be able to disarm it.
It's a boobytrap... Not much of one... I should be able to disarm it.
Swallowing too much water... Can't keep my head up...
This mission's behind us.

Poor planning, bad luck, whatever... You'd better start making some headway if you want me to consider joining your team.
It's too risky working for you. Call me if you learn not to take so many chances with our lives!
Maybe...when I first started, I might have put up with the insanity of revolving mercenaries, but not anymore! I quit!
And you can keep your money tucked safely in your pocket, because that's my final word!
If you're ever in need of a competent explosives expert, you know where to find me.
It's been a pleasure working for you, more of a pleasure than you'll ever know.
What's with this fink, Weasel? I can't work with a guy I don't trust, one of us has to go!


Time is working against us.
Nice, I'm glad I'm working for you!
You're the type of commander I might even enjoy working for!



I can't be part of this losing effort any longer!
For the umpteenth time...
I don't accept credit cards, IOU's, checks, or camels... It's cash! And you don't have it.
I just need time to work out some details.
I can't be part of this losing effort any longer!

If you're shopping for an explosive expert, feel free to check out the competition. I have no family history of psychiatric illness or sheet metal in my head.
I don't take unnecessary risks. You'll have to run the operation with hardly any casualties if you want me to go.
You might want to stay away from the low-end guys. They only end-up shooting each other.
I don't accept credit cards, IOU's, checks, or camels...
Show some decency and leave me alone!


I'm scheduled to do a fireworks' show tonight in Libya.
Now what are you going to do for an explosive specialist? Hire one of those basket cases?

Visual contact.
The enemy's here.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
Heads up, we got a pukazoid.
Are those real? God, they are! They're like something out of a B-horror movie.
Looks like the pukazoids had a party.
Heard something.
Ugh, maybe I should call those things Dungazoids.
I got a hunch we're about to step into something.
Every time I turn around, I expect one of those pukazoids to be waiting.
Call out the goddamned cavalry!
Is that worth checking out?
What's this?
Time for a resupply of lead.
I need Morphine... Demerol... something!
Ron, darling, we always knew this day would come. I'm glad it was you first, because... because I didn't want to leave you alone, the way I am now. Peace be with you, my love.

I'm sorry to have lost you, Donna. I feel like I hardly got to know you. I promise, you won't be forgotten.
Lost my train of thought.
Need to unjam this gun A.S.A.P.
I'm gettin' a lot of attention!
I better get combat pay for this. Oh, wait, I already am.
That sure gets the adrenaline surging.
I'd probably miss that one on my best day.
I'm losing blood.
I'm beat. Time to see what's playing on the ol' eyelid theatre.
Gotta stop... gotta breathe.
Problem solved.
That pukazoid's worm food.



Sorry, Mike. But you made a bad career choice.
I'd go easy on the details of the death when telling their mother.

Need something to do.
That's not going to happen.
I got you, my pretty... and your little dog, too.
The Queen is dead. Long live the rest of us.
That wiseass's breath could peel paint.
I wouldn't mind packing up and going home.
These guys are all lunatics and bottom-feeders.
Aerial bombardment!
Wonder how many box tops they sent in to get these supplies.


I'm getting the hang of this.
Is it just me, or is that utterly ridiculous?
Knock me over with a feather.


They don't get any better than Raider.

Way to go, Spiderwoman!
Too soon for me. Gotta see how things go.
What a weird turn of events. Mike's here.
Right in the eye! Good God, I'm blind.
I could do that forever and still get nowhere!
How do people live in a place like this and still keep their sanity?
Hostiles have been detected in the quadrant.
We haven't taken care of all of them. Something to keep in mind.

A fine weapon.
There he is! Grab that kid.
I don't think she's going to get too far with that, Miguel. We can help you out. The rules are going to be a little different now.
That's a wrap. We've secured the quadrant.
Did they think we weren't going to notice stuff missing?
Dearest had that coming. I just didn't see any other way to do it.
Mother of God...
Good work! Yeah, I'm going to miss all this. Then again, maybe there's another gig just over the horizon. Let me know, okay?
Guess the hostiles ran off to regroup.
I'm going to commune with my pillow. Lots more productive after a few winks.
That did the trick. I'm working again.
I was just going to say that.
Not good. Got an equipment failure here.
Call in explosives. It's rigged.
Careful, keep your focus to the ground. Probably meant for us.
<glub> Help! Anyone! Help... Ron...
I'm here. Always loved to travel.

I don't think so. I've read about you and your exploits.
Can't sign with you. I've grown fond of breathing.
Sorry. Can't find a sitter for the puppies.
Sorry, I'm going to a gun show. Give me some notice next time.
Hi, this is Charlene Higgens. You can leave me a message, or if you have my pager number, you can beep me.
Pleasure working with you. Like to use you as a reference, if you don't mind.



My contract's about up for renewal. I'm interested, if you are.
Good. I like this arrangement.
Done. I'm sure it'll be fun.
If my husband will work for you, so will I. Let's do it.

Well, I'd be frankly a little disinclined if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Houston, Spider that is, is on the team. She's great. So, I'm willing.
I just want to put this whole experience behind me.
I'm sorry. I said...
I understand your bank account is, how do I put this politely, insufficient.
Que sera sera. Lucky for you, I don't take these things personally.

Charlene Higgens.
I'm especially fond of night ops, if you anticipate a strong need in that area.
Can we hurry this up? I have some calls to make.
How long a contract do you want to arrange?
When you know what you want, give me a call.


Keep in mind that my commitment is coming to a close here.
I'm really moving up! Figured my pay should reflect that.

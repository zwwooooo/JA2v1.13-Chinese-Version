Couldn't stay away.  Could you?
Look whos back.
All you've done is attact attention to yourself.
Kill.
Hmmmm this is going to be interesting.
Don't exactly blend in.
Sound reminicent of something to you?
As if that wasn't a dead give away.

It could mean our extinction.
Hmmm how absolutely intoxicating.
I'm sure I'll take it.
Isn't this better.
I'll guess I'll ask someone else to finish this.
Protect me.
You've killed my precious.
Loss of life is a tragedy.
You've killed my dear dear artist.  I'll never forgive you.

Not an accident.
You'll have my complete attention.
It's sad really.
Thanks, all you've done is attract attention to yourself.
I think it might be a little much to ask.
Attention
Poor dear just can't get a break.
The truth can be cruel.
Think nothing of it.
Why can't they all be like you.
Naive.
It must take a lot of time to adjust to that form.
Were you trying to be witty or profound
Murderer.
No.  Are you into that kind of thing? Urrghhh!
Poor dear Just can't get a break.
It should be enough.
No.
Apology accepted.
Your as dead as you feel darling.
I'm willing to ignore the incredible lengths you've gone to be an asshole.
Have you already forgotten your humanity.
I'm beginning to think it was fate.
I'm a bit nervous.
Tha will do nicely.


Feel free to flaunt it.
Is it very difficult carrying that heavy weight of suspicion around your neck?
That will do nicely.
You're quite gifted in pissing people off.
Isn't is uncomfortable.
I'm like a book.  All you have to do is run your finger down my spine and crack me open to see what I'm about.
I do appreciate your help a lot.
After this is over, I promise you will have my complete attention.
If you can't appreciate just how generous the gift of my presence is, maybe you should spend your time indulging in something more suited to your tastes, like a carnival or something.
Its gonna be dangerous.
<blinded> Is it very difficult?
Forget I brought it up.
I simply adore you.
I won't lie, it's gonna be dangerous.
No witnesses please.
Acceptable.
I found a weapon.
I've heard a lot about you.
You may be able to wash that blood of your hands easily but my concious will soak in it.
Think nothing of it.
A shame.
I'm sorry.
Is it dangerous?
Through this ordeal I have gained an enticing new ally.
If it has to be that way.


I was just thinking the same thing.
Getting careless.
Too insightful to be coincidental.
I don't want to spoil the moment.

This is going to be interesting.

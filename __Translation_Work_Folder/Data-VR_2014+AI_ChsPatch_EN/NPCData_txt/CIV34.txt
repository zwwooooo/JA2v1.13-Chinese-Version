Thank you for helping us.
I wanna stitch Tina a big love heart on her T-shirt.
I am scared no more. I can walk past the bar without being scared of Cockeye.
I'm gonna help my Dad dig a bomb shelter for us.
I like Tina, but I miss real school.
Haha! You are in love with Tina! You are in love with Tina!!!
My mother is going to be very happy.
Mama says big gun, small brain!
You got rid of Cockeye? Can you get the Queen next?
Got some spare cents, G.I. Joe?
Have you seen my dog?
What kind of accent is that?
Cockeye no more! Cockeye no more!
I hated Cockeye!
We can go play!

Enemy!
They're here!
Won't talk my way out of this one.
Beasty bug!
I've heard the rumors before. But seeing these beasts for myself? Words don't do justice.
I don't want to stay here any longer than absolutely necessary.
Shh! Keep your ears open!
The air here is noxious! Let's do what we came here for and get out while we can.
I've got a bad feeling about this. And I've learned to trust my instincts.
Careful! Don't touch anything barehanded. You might catch something.
No! Not like this! I'm taking as many of you with me as I can!
Look.
Over here.
What a moment to run out of ammo.
Can't take this pain...
Eagle could have just kept his head down and worked at the dam. But he didn't. And for what? To die in a ditch fighting someone else's war? ... I'm tired. I don't know how much longer I can go on.


Wait... What was I doing again?
Not now!
I'm not dying in fucking Arulco!
I should have left when I had the chance.
Gotta keep low!
I don't think I can pull it off.
I'm losing blood. Let's hope it's not internal.
Need a break.
Need to... catch a breath.
One less to worry about.
What a nightmare...
Norma thinks she's invincible. I don't get how someone so smart can be so reckless. Always charging head first like she's immune to bullets or something. She'll get one of us killed with that attitude eventually.
I'm sure you think it's cute having a guy called "Haywire" in your squad, but trying to stay alive next to a maniac whose skills are limited to "spray and pray" gets old pretty quick. Can you hire someone normal instead?

Just another of the Queen's men. They can justify their reasons all they want, they're all the same.
It doesn't feel real.
I feel unwell.
Good news. All done over here.
To be honest, I'd rather not.
Just like that. It's over. For good.
Gotta hand it to you, looks like the mine's all clear of those beasty bugs. Not a moment too soon either! As long as those things, well, stay dead, we'll be all right.
There are too many of this kind of person here.
I don't see how anyone could do that.
I hope you guys know what you're doing.
We are under attack! Run for cover!
This stuff is barely up to civilian standards. How are we supposed to fight against an army?
After you people killed the Queen, well, the first time anyway, it seemed for a moment like things were going to change for the better. Then, before you know it, it's all back to failed state again.
The last thirteen years have been the longest six-month stint I ever did.
Guess there are still things to learn after all.
Can't shake a bad feeling about this.
One bad decision after another.


Well, I'm glad Eagle is here. It's nice to talk to someone from the industry. Reminds me of better days.


I'm not asking for much. Just bare minimum.
Really? You couldn't even pay me the pennies I asked for?
I should have worn eye protection!
I'm doing the best I can. But it's not enough.
There is still some good left in this country.
They're here! It's gonna start any moment now.
We're not out of the woods yet. Stay vigilant!
It might be of some use.
As long as I'm on this side of the barrel.
Hey! It's that kid everyone's looking for!
I understand. I know you haven't got all day to stand around and chat, so I'll be on my way.
Maybe there's still some hope left for this country. Just don't get complacent.
Our cargo is missing. It happened at the platform all the time too. Everyone here is just trying to get ahead.
It needed to be done. No way around it.
Tiger!
Well. Can't believe I made it through in one piece. I have to think about what I'm gonna do from this point forward - I didn't even have a chance with all that was happening before.
Looks like they retreated. We live to see another day.
I can't stay awake much longer. We'll talk tomorrow.
I'm up.
Can't argue with that.
It looks broken beyond repair.
Careful, looks like this could take your arm clean off.
Watch where you step! There's something here.
I can't... keep afloat...
I'm here. What now?

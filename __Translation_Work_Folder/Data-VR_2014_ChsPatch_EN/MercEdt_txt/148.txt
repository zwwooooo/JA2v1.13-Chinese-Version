We've got company!
There they are!
There's a whole lot of them.
Bug!
What in tarnation is that?!
We shouldn't linger here more than we need to.
Heard some noises.
This stink's unbearable! Let's wrap up and leave before we choke on it.
Can't shake a bad feeling about this.
Watch your hands. Wouldn't want to catch whatever these critters are carrying.
Got a whole colony over here!
What's that?
What's that?
Of all the times to run dry...
Lord! This hurts something awful...
Goddamit, Greg. You didn't deserve none of the shit that happened to you. I'm gonna miss you... Looks like I'll have to say hi from you to the Queen myself.


Hold on... What was the plan again?
Man, gun's jammed.
Keep your head down, it's raining lead!
Just a minor setback.
That was a close one!
C'mon, get a grip!
Bleeding here... and not getting any better.
Time for a breather.
Just need to... catch my wind a sec.
That's one problem taken care of.
That's one nasty bug taken care of.
I can't believe you let that snake Gillitt back on your team. How many more times he gonna switch sides, man?



That's gonna leave a mark...
Ain't feeling too hot.
Wanted to let you know that we're all done over here.
Ain't gonna happen...
And this time... stay down!
Well, thank God that's over. Tell you what though, I hear any of them noises again, I'm outta here.
Too many shady folks around these parts.
I trusted you knew what you're doing. Not so sure anymore.
Let me put it this way, you can't blame a whole country for the cruelty of its dictator. It's sad, but I got a feeling change is coming soon.
Incoming! Find somewhere to hunker down!
This gear ain't fit for a proper fight.
I hope you ain't getting a bad feeling about Arulco. I mean, when it's all over, you might want to consider a vacation here. It's nice.
Hey, I just keep myself concerned with everything under the ground. What happens above the grass line, I'll leave in your hands.
Seems life's still full of lessons.
You serious?
I don't know what you expected.
I can't stand looking at Gillitt anymore. It reminds me of what the army did to my brother. Get rid of him and then we can talk.

That's right! You show them, Greg!


Ain't asking for the moon. Just what's fair.
Can't believe you couldn't cough up the small change I needed.
Darn it! Can't see shit!
Man, I tried.
You and I are gonna get along just fine.
They're closing in! Brace yourselves!
We ain't safe yet. Eyes peeled.
Now that's what I like to see.
That's one hell of a gun!
Hey, ain't that the young'un folks been talking about?
I hoped this time I'd see her to the grave. Well, you know where you find me if you change your mind.
We wiped them all out. Got what they deserve.
Lost our cargo again. Folks just trying to make it by any means.
Ain't nobody gonna miss you.
Watch out! Big cat!
We did it! After all we went through... She's back where she belongs... six feet under. We won't forget your help. I swear, man, we won't forget your help.
Ran back to their Queen, huh?
I'm out. See ya in the morning.
We got a lot to do.
Hard to argue with that.
No man, that's broken.
Watch it. That looks dangerous.
That ain't right. Watch where you step.
I can't... swim any longer...
I'm here. What's next?

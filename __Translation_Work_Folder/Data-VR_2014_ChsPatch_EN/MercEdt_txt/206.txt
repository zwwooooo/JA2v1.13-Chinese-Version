Enemies!
Another suicidal.
Damn, is there a nest of them here?!
There's a monster!
Wow! What a beast!
What a disaster!
Listen! Someone's there!
Has anybody burned his tires around here?
Watch out! They're waiting for us.
They are still here. We're gonna smash 'em.
I will bring another fallout of you! 
Stuff!
Something useful?
Oh man, my gun's empty!
Is this my end...? Come on devil, wherever you hiding!
It can't be true, you can't be dead!

This isn't real, right?!?
Oh sorry, what was it?
Damn peashooter is jamned!
Is that all you got? Pathetic!
Ouch! That stings!
What a pathetic attempt!
Ain't gonna hit that.
Don't you worry! Girls can take the bleeding. Oh but this is more than usual...
Very tired. Definately time for a kip.
Cannot breathe, wait a sec!
Forgive me father, I have killled!
Cowards.
Dr. Q the weird Chinese guy?! He is not be trusted!


Mike is dead!
What the crap? Come on! This isn't real, right?!
Everybody is heading away from this country, not into it!
All Finished! I hope it was to everybodies satisfaction.
What do you think? Do yourself, Moron!
We not really gonna miss her, right?
As hard to kill as a cockroach. But not hard enough.
What a dumbass! 
Join the mercenaries they said, but this just sucks!
Join the mercenaries they said. Join an elite team they said. Just you look at that pathetic bunch of losers I'm stuck working with?!
Planes! Not ours I guess!
Join the mercenaries they said. Get lots of loot they said. Look at that pathetic bunch of crap I'm expected to use.

I am sure you'll soon learn to appreciate the skills of a woman like me in your team.
 I will be even better, just let me do my thing!
Bad idea! Don't do it.
I told you...
Wanna keep that acupuncture guy? But forget me then!

Yeah really interesting!

One tough guy!
Somebody said I was gonna get some payment, right?
Mike is a damn good mercenary.
Someone up the bloody gamma value, it's damn dark!
Failure is not somethin' I want to waste my time on!
Hey, hello, Mister Nice Guy...
Enemies around! Move your asses ladies, we're gonna rock!
They've got guts - I mean - they are still here. But just wait till I am finished with them.
Oh Wow, look over there, up there in the sky, do you see that?! This belongs to me now!
Good weapon, well done!
I think I know this guy - never dated him though.
Dumb move. But maybe we'll meet again. I still have the flowers from you.
Oh, where did they all go? Actually, on second thoughts... I'm not sure I really wanna know.
There is stuff missing! And by the looks of these boxes, we got some giant rat problem.
Bad girls don't make it as far as I do.
A 'Wildcat'! Oh look how thin they are. Why does nobody feed them? Are there no park rangers around?!
We made it!! Let's go party! And I'd keep your hands off of me this time round, unless you prefer shaking hands with the left that is!
Those cowards! They've run off!
I'm am so tired. Need to go to bed.
Here I come! Again...
Yeah, me too!
Maybe this crap used to work but not anymore.
Now what is that? 
The ground here looks suspicous!
I can't swim!
Right I'm here! Orders?

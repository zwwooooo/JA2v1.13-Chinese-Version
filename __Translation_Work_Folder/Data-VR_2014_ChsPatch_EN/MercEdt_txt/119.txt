Oh my!
Oh, no...
I never thought I'd find myself in the middle of a war!



Talking!

I thought you were going to leave me here forever!


All kinds of stuff!
Giving the stuff away!
Make sure everything was ok!
Oh my gosh... I'm bleeding!
Oh my God John... JOHN!


Remember me?
Make sure everything was ok!
I never thought I'd find myself in the middle of a war!
In pain!
Oh my!
I have very mixed feelings about it!
I'm bleeding!
In pain!
In pain!
Nice!





Gosh!

Everything works!
No!
No appreciation!
No appreciation!
No appreciation!
John was crazy for trusting you!
I wanted to go to Disneyland in Orlando.
The airport!
Terrible!
I spent my honeymoon in Paris... Texas!

Finally!
No!
John was crazy for trusting you!


John!




I don't see!
Stop going on about it!
It's nice to make your acquaintance.
I never thought I'd find myself in the middle of a war!
Organising!
Thanks a lot now!
Nice!


Finally!
Well, that's not quite true!
History!
Aruba!
Just to be safely out of this country and back into the arms of my children!
Finally!


Whatever you say!
Terrible!
I have very mixed feelings about it!
I have very mixed feelings about it!
Oh, no... Oh, no..!
Already there!

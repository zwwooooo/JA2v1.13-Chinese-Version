There's an enemy here!
I've made contact! Enemy unaware of my presence.
I've made contact with a couple of enemies!
I've made contact!
I've made contact!
We have to be careful
I have to stay more alert...
We have to be careful
We have to be careful
I am beginning to wonder if there are any enemies.
Enemies!
There seems to be something over here.

Ammo! I'm out of ammo!
Been hit real bad... Can't move... Getting weaker...




Gun's jammed!
I'm being fired at!
Might need medical attention!
That is nowhere close
I'll probably miss.
I'm bleeding! I need to patch myself up.
I'm tired. I need a break...
I'm tired. I need a break...
Not a chance!
Not a chance!



It is going very well for us!
Oh my God!
My father was a loser. I can't stay here any longer!
We did it.
I don't think this is an appropriate time!

Not a chance!

I almost feel bad about getting paid for this.
You guys are almost too funny to shoot.
So when does the fighting start?
I can't seem to get it to work.
Well... It had to be one of us.

That seems satisfactory!
I should have packed a lunch. Looks like there's plenty of opportunity for a picnic.

Better next time...
I've made contact!
Oh my God!
There better be no mention of this incident in my record!

We'd better be careful. I'm ready when you are.
I am beginning to wonder if there are any enemies.

I think that was the last of that team.

Well, it had to be one of us.
I've made contact!
There really is no better feeling than coming out on top.
I am beginning to wonder if there are any enemies.
I'm tired. I need a break...
There's no need to push me!
I'll need at least another day.
I guess I could use more experience at this!
It looks like it's been tampered with.
We better be careful. The ground doesn't seem right.
I'm out of breath... Going under... water!
I'm ready when you are!

This is pointless! I'm finished negotiating with you.
You should be looking to hire a mortician - not a doctor!
I'm not that interested... My father was a loser! And you're a little down on your luck yourself!
Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking for something a little more permanent!
I've had other inquiries. I'll get back to you shortly.
I look forward to working with you again.



We running out of time!
It's great to be appreciated. I'm ready when you are!
I'm in!



When you get serious about the team you want, you can give me a call. But for now, I am outta here!
Like I said before...
You appear to lack the funds necessary to hire me.
Well, maybe we can work something out next time.
I've had enough! There are way too many of us dying down here!






Like I said before...
You appear to lack the funds necessary to hire me.
I revived two mercenaries, both of whom had been dead for well over five minutes. What more could you ask for from your team physician?
Don't judge Larry too harshly. He's got a problem. I just wish he would listen to me. I can get him some help...
I am interested, but I believe you could do better.
You really don't know what you want, do you?
Maybe we can work something out next time.


For personal reasons, I've decided to take the day off.
My services appear to be in demand. I'll be accepting the assignment that offers the highest signing bonus.

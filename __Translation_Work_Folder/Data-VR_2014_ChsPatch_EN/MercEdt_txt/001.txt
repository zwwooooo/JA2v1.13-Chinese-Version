Enemy in sight.
Well, what do we have here?
This bites, man! Big time!
It's another one of them skuzzwads.
Jellydog, that's one ugly son of a bitch.
Somethin' wicked came this way, man.
Sounds like somethin's moving.
<sniff> <sniff> Guess those things never heard of deodorant.
My stomach's doin' flips.
I bet those suckers are watchin' us, man.
These skuzzwads are tryin' to make me the entree!
Well, lookee here.
Somethin's over here.
Out of ammo.
Oh, man, I'm dead meat.
Shoot. Outta everyone, I never thought you'd be the one to bite it, Magic. Thought you were invincible, man.


Um...sorry, I'm out of it.
Oh, perfect time for my gun to jam.
These suckers are bustin' my chops!
They're not wastin' me that easily.
I wasn't worried. Right.
Like I'm gonna pull that off...
Oh, man, Blood's bleedin' blood.
I'm bushed.
Gotta stop for a moment. I'm not 18 anymore.
Hah! He's toast!
One filleted mignon, comin' up!
That old wino Highball's gettin' on my nerves.

Bubba's just a trash-talkin', knuckle-walkin' redneck.
Aww, Mike wasn't so tough after all! I killed women who went down a lot harder than he did!
Jellydog, nothin's left of that guy but hamburger.

All done here.
I don't think so.
No autographs, please. I'm a humble hero!
All right! I heard they taste like chicken. Now I get to find out!
Fool's got spam for brains.
I could be home right now, eatin' take out.
If I wanted to work with clowns, I woulda joined the circus.
Blue ice coming down!
Why doesn't anyone ever check out my gear? It's crap.

Don't get me started on South Africans, man. I wanna stay focused on the job here.
I surprise myself sometimes.
Even I can see that's a pitiful plan.
A blind man coulda seen that comin'.
Hey, you brought on that cracker Cliff, I'm halfway out the door. You know what I'm sayin'? I'll think twice about renewing if working with him's part of the deal.

Magic's got it goin' on. You know what I'm sayin'? Class act!


Well, I gotta see how things go awhile yet.
Oh, man, it's Mike! That dude is like a legend!
It burns like acid, man. Can't see nothin'.
This is like going nowhere fast!
Everybody's got an angle. You know what I'm saying?
Pickin' up signs of aggressors movin' about.
We didn't do a clean sweep. Still got a couple of scuzzballs hanging around.

Don't mess with me!
Gotta grab that kid. If it's Joey boy, I think I'm gonna play daddy for a bit.
We'll take care of business, Miguel. They don't want to be messing with us.
They're all cooked!
Hey... It's not all here. Someone want to tell me where the stuff has gone?
Hey man, he was like a burned piece of chicken. Sometimes you gotta throw food away. You know what I'm saying?
Skinned cat coming up!
That's it, man! Like, when I get this feeling right in the gut like a great steak, you know? But this is even better. You keep tight, man. You know where to find me.
They've gone running back to mama. We're alone for now.
I gotta crash for a bit. I'll get back on it when I get some sleep.
Ah, feeling good and moving on.
Same here!
It broke! Crappy hand-me-downs...
Whoa, man. This is trapped!
Careful. Looks like someone's trying to dice us.
<glub> Don't let me... go under...
Order's up, man. I'm here.

I know of your command. And I don't need the work that badly.
No thank you. I'm not goin' home in a baggie.
Well, see, the annual Texas Chili Cook-off is this weekend, and I don't wanna miss that.
My old lady wants me to get a vasectomy, and if I skip out on one more appointment, she's gonna do it herself. Gimme some notice next time.
Hello! Pretty high-tech, eh? This is cool. I'm into this! Leave me a message! And hey...welcome to the 90's!
Okay by me, I got places to go and things to do. Maybe I'll catch you some other time.
I ain't working with that Cliff Highball. There's something about drunks and scalpels that just gives me the sweats.

Oh, yeah, that Bubba's just achin' to put a bullet in my back while nobody's lookin'. Not me, unh-unh.
Hey, brother, my contract's almost up. Anything else I can do for you?
All right, I'm back in the saddle again.
All right, now you're cookin' with fire.
Anyone who's got Magic Walker on their team's gotta be doin' something right. You got me, too.


I dunno. I kinda lost my appetite for this whole deal. Later, man.
Listen, I said...
Y'see, I gotta get paid, and your portfolio looks a bit thin right now.
Well, if that's how it's gotta be, then that's how it'll be. Your loss, man. Later.
No thank you. I'm not goin' home in a baggie.

Yeah, Blood here, wussup?
I'm heavy into martial arts, man...tae kwon do, ju jitsu, karate, judo, you name it. I'm into enough stuff that they didn't have room for it on my resume.
Pick it up, man.
How long are you planning to keep me on?
Let me know when you got it goin' on. I might be around.


Sorry to say it, man, but my time here's almost up.
I'm worth a bit more now. Know what I'm saying?

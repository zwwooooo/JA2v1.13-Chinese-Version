Hey duckie.
So THAT's what passes for a soldier around here.
Me and my big mouth! Always got me into trouble!
Got a crawler! Christ, I hate those things.
Reminds me of a night drinkin' bathtub hooch.
Those just don't seem natural. They give me the willies, bub.
Pretty sure I picked up noise, Chief.

Gotta keep a clear head around here.
I hate this! Place is probably crawling with them crawlers.
Crud! I'm not gettin' this Chief.
Check this out.
Goodies here.
Ammo's spent, guys.
Took it really bad...I need some medical attention...now.
That's too bad. Larry seemed to be in a really good mood the past couple of days.
Oh that aint right. Spider was a swell dame. Gonna miss her.

What's happenin'?
This ain't cool! My gun's broken, Chief.
Takin' heat, fellas!
Gonna be a long night, folks.
That stinks.
I don't know. Don't look in the bag to me, fellas.
I'm staring at blood, man... my BLOOD!
Need to punch out Chief.
Hunh, woah. I'm wheezing.
I'm gettin' it!
That's a relief.
Larry ain't right. He just ain't cool. He ain't the pal I used to know. Makes me sick to my stomach.
Something about Stephan that just ain't good. He's just a little too...too. I can't put my finger on it, Chief.
Razor's a chump. So keep some distance between us.
Their team's got another opening, folks.
Looked like Mardi Gras on a bender! Creepy.
I hate bugs, fellas. Especially bugs that are bigger than me.
I'm up-to-date, Chief!
I didn't quite get that... well, okay, I did... but I'm ignoring it.
That was a jip.
I think we should burn it just to be sure, aye.
Born in a tunnel for sure.
I've had more fun clipping my toe nails.
This unit's like the Keystone cops.
Look out! They're attacking from above, guys.
Bet somebody used this equipment huntin' Pancho Villa, man.
It'd be kinda cool just to hangout down here.
Them Swiss get my goat. I think it's 'cause they're just too damn neutral. You know, kinda like cardboard people.
I sort of felt something, Chief.
Might want to take a look at that on paper.
I'm stuck.
Larry's turned into one preachy pain in the ass! If you really feel you need him, keep us apart, okay?
Keep that Swiss desk-jockey Stephan clear of me. I wouldn't be here if I'd known he was comin'.
Larry's alright, Chief. You think his head's elswhere, Bingo! He comes through.
Two thumbs up, Spider!

Be patient, aye... we'll get around to it.
So... this is where Mike's been working.
Got bug piss in my eyes!
This is a waste of time.
Seemed kinda cool.
Take it easy... enemies are around here.
Tired of chasing 'em! They'll rear their ugly heads soon enough.

Think I'm startin' to like this squirrel gun.
Over there! Isn't that the momma's boy?
I didn't quite get that...well...okay. It'd be kinda cool just to hang out down here.
Show's over folks. They're just pushing up weeds now.
You know...I don't think everything's here, Chief.
Didn't have no choice, fellas... They started this thing.
Giant Polecats!
It was swell while it lasted. Let me know if ya' wanna' do it again.
They went on the long march, Chief.
My lids are heavy, Chief. Gotta punch out.
I'm needin' sleep. I'm ready to work now.
Aye, me too.
This thing ain't working.
Watch it. This thing is rigged.
I don't like the way that ground looks at all.
Damn swimmin' hole! Can't cut it... I'm going under... drowning...
Traveling's over, Chief. I'm ready for whatever.

Hey look.
Hey wait a second.
Well I guess when you got nothing to go home to, you got nothing to lose.
That thing is ugly and its in my way.
Hey alligator.
Come and get me.
I don't see anyone out there.
He he he that reminds me of this crazy office halloween party we had once.

Fiendish!
Monsters, again?
Got something here that might interest you.
Check these babies out.
Its really not much use without bullets.
I don't think I can swallow any more metal right now.
You killed my best friend.
Compadre.
He truely give his body to the cause.

Hey, about that gun.
Crazy.
I don't got the lungs for it.
Yeah you like that!
I'm saving my ammo for the big guy.
Dang.
Ah, to sleep.
Mind if I sit down Charlie?
Hey we all run out of luck eventually.
See this is why I don't have a pet.
Now that guy really needs his beauty rest.
Hey sugar lips.
Poor guy, so nervous I think he is going to be sick.
I thought he looked mad before.
They can't feel it, their dead.
Ohh, its spooky down here.
Ah don't sweat it mano.
Really, why?
Lets just say it had something to do with justice.
I can't believe i killed it.
Thats how this whole mess got started in the first place.
This is sad.
Its the fear of death that makes monsters of us all.
Oh no.
Still got it.


Nothing like the real McCoy.
No I won't.

Come on, were getting out of here.
Ah I forget, I'm I supposed to be somewhere right now.
Thats one dedicated soldier.
So good to see him again.
Maybe Hector is not all that bad.
No piggy back rides today.
Nice to see him above ground again.
Little dark in here, don't you think?
I think i have tortured it enough.
Good. Excellant. Carry on.
Come out and fight you platypuses.
Run for your lives you buck-toothed glowballs.
Yes I better take this with me.  For safe keeping.
I'm going to blow the lid off this place.
You know when we leave I'm going to miss this place.
This can't be happening.
Viva la Revolution.
Alright, hand over the rest of it.
Its amazing how a little touch of human remains can brighten up a place.
Good kitty.
Poor bone wagon
Long gone my friend, theres nothing here for us now.


Why didn't I think of that?
I just got this thing.
I don't wanna do anything that might jar it loose.
Ok but if you hear a lot of explosion anytime soon, the trips off.

Done it already.

Somethings not right about this.
You have a lot of explaining to do.
Look at these poor saps.

I wonder if this thing is rated for rodents.
Well I...
What makes you think I'm gonna work for you?
You still have some explaining to do.
No, I won't
The only implication here is that I'm fired.
If you say so.
Good enough for me.
Yeah, you heard me.
Sure, here it is.
Good, excellant, carry on.
You can have it, I'm leaving town.
I can handle anything you got.
Errr...no.
This is a code red situation.
I can't tolerate all this injustice, i'm leaving.
I better go finish packing.
Ok see you later, chicken.
Too bad, I win.
Ok I'm in, what do I have to do?
Alright, lets go buddy.
Well there you go.
Last chance.
Yeah but your credits no good to boot.
Hey.
What exactly are you looking for?
Hello?
I think we need to talk.
Plenty more where that came from.
Just whos in on this deal?
I can't believe he doesn't trust me.
I want to put out your lights my friends.
Well it was gonna happen eventually.

There is a man named Perko in Salinas. He can repair almost anything. I do not know if this information is useful to you.
I give advice. Stay away from San Mona. It is a very bad town. It is full of sinners.
That drunken pig; 'Cockeye' is bullying the locals again. I swear he is an informant for the Queen.
There is a reporter here but she seems troubled. She can't be from around here, she talks funny!
Do you also hideout in the swamp house northeast of here?
Do you stay in that swamp house directly east of here?
Do you come from that swamp house southeast of here?
Is your hideout that house in the swamp southwest of here?
I'm sick of the bloodshed. Sick of Arulco being the world's punching bag.

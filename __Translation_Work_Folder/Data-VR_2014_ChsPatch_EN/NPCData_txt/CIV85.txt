You fucked up, big time!
You don't know who you're messing with.
We're gonna use your guts for chum out in the bay!
We'll dump your body out to sea like the rest of them.
You're gonna go swim with the fishes!
Don't you know Kingpin owns this part of the world?
I'll send regards to your family!
Wrong time, wrong place, you piece o' shit!
Your funeral!
Vaffanculo a chi t'Ã¨ morto!
You're in a whole world of hurt now, numbnuts!
You lucked out this time, my friend.
I'm gonna whack this mook!
Takin' on Kingpin? You must've been dropped on your head when you were a bambino!
I'm gonna turn the sand red with you!

Mighty fine to see you folks. The name's Dwight, Dwight McGraw, you can call me... Dwight.
Howdy...
Shoot, I thought Arizona was dry, but this place is drier than happy hour at a Betty Ford clinic.
Nope, I'm a just passin' through, got me some business in this little old country.
No thanks, my friend. Prefer to travel light in these parts, you keep it.
Arulco's a bona-fide prime investment area, let me tell ya! If folks stopped to look past their nose.... well that n' maybe clean up some of these dead bodies strewn across the street.
Well listen to you, Billy Sunday!
No sir, you boys look like you can handle yourself good enough, and besides me with a gun is about as useful as a screendoor on a submarine.
Oh brother, feels like I bin 'et by a wolf and shit over a cliff.
I gotta keep on moving, business opportunities like this don't grow on trees y'know.
***Angel purchase line after bought kevlar jacket***
***offer line for Kevlar jacket say $950 dollars***
***You don't owe me any money.***
***And how will you be paying for that?***
Now I'm a not normally into givin' away trade secrets, but we may just be able to help each other out...
As you know Arulco's had it tough in these here parts, not only the people, but the land too, and all this mining well,  that aint helping no one 'cept the oil barons.
Thing is, I've got on my person what amounts to gold dust in these here parts... Now bare with me, it's genetically modified bulls semen from an October cow! All the way from Texas!
These cows they're a miracle of modern science! Let me tell ya; they produce the same amount of milk even the same amount of beef that a normal cow does, 'cept 'cause they're smaller in stature they use up 50 percent less arable land.
Do the math, that means farmers can farm on land a fraction of the size they'd normally need to make a crust.
I've had the Cubans make me offers, which makes the Americans looking to compete, and even the Chinese think it's worth the money to generate more meat to put in their stir fries,
Hell, I even had a Traconian threaten me at the airport, but I don't want to deal with any of these people and if I did, I swear, I'm likely to be buried penniless in a ditch somewhere!
Now I've got me a less trigger-happy Arulcan buyer lined up, but I need an escort, and around these here parts I need a good one, so I'll pay you well.
You get me to my meeting point at Salinas, and you've got 10,000 more smackeroonies to play with in San Mona once my transaction's been finalised.
Good doing business with you folks.
***Dwight recruited***
You, my friend, are about to get the deal of the century for all those hungry little Arulcans to feed off. This sample is all you need....well...that an a turkey baster and some big ol' rubber gloves.
Now trouble is this stuff is sought-after, my friend, hell, I was lucky to even get it here in one piece. I been feeling more jumpy than a long tailed cat in a room full of rockin' chairs.
I know there's already two damn bunch of hoodlums tailing me and looking to take it away for themselves, I can just smell it! If they know I have it for sure, shit will hit the fan!
You'll be making milk and opening steak houses all over Arulco before the end of second harvest.
Well, I love it when a plan comes together...good doing business with you folks.  Fortune favours the bold, and here's 10,000 bills to fold for the favour you did me. 
Well, I ought to be making tracks. The CIA have a way of making people disappear, and ways different from what I had in mind. And don't talk to me about the Traconians, those folk have a thumpin' gizzard for a heart, I shit you not.
You idiot! Just about every Traconian or CIA spook is going to be posting our faces on wanted posters all over this two-bit town now!
You're as mad as a mule chewing on bumblebees!


Lie like a rug you damn fool! Can't you hear that gun fire!



Well look who it ain't. Wasn't expecting to see you boys again 'cept maybe reading about your exploits in the newspapers.
Now....Now hold on, I didn't know for one doggone minute those samples were fake, and I payed good-tootin money for them back in the world, so I'm a just about as hard done-by as you!
I feel like a banjo, everyone's picking on me! Here's all the money I have left. Them thar airlines don't fly on thin air y'know.
Jesus H. Christ on a popsicle stick! I'm a telling you the truth! I had to spend some of the money on lodgings and my ticket outta here! 
Holy sheet, *coff* *wheeze* my mama once done told me if you lie with dogs you'll get up with fleas....Here, that's IT! Everything I have!
I'm a sorry fellahs, there's just too many folk around that aint no good.

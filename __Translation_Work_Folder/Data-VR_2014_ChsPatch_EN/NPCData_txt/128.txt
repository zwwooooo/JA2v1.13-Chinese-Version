We no meet before... Arnold Brunzwell, Arulco's Blacksmith and Handyman. Whatever the need, I fix it for you in no time. Well, not much time, anyway.
You again, huh? You got work for me, I guess.
Is an old trade, blacksmith. Machines, computers, they no do it right. Take a special hand and eye to get metal into shape.
I fix anything for you, but I no like electronics. Me and Fredo, we have a pact. He no become a blacksmith, I no fix electronics.
Interesting, but I no want it.
Business pick up lately. Arulco's army men blow up everything! Is always something to be fixed. Bad for the country. Good for me.
Hot one outside, no? Dis weather, it make people go crazy! Hunh?
No, hot metal belongs in a forge, not in me. I no want to die.
I suffer, terribly...
I get back to work now.
Maybe you tell me first what you need fixed.
You relax, man. Let me know what I can do for you. I get it done fast, fast, fast. Anything but electronics... get it back to you in about half an hour.
I'm thinking, maybe someday, I do the half-hour guarantee, like a pizza place, no? Half-hour for your repair or it's free. Then again, maybe I wait 'til the war is over.
Speed and efficiency, they be my mottos.

Something you need fixed, man?
All right, then. Let me have a look at what you got.
No, man. Not electronics. I told you, Fredo and I have a deal. You take the wirey stuff to him to fix.
Ah, dis looks fine! No need to fix it.
Oh, I don't know if I could fix dis! I give it a try. Mean extra work for me, so I charge you a bit more.
Yeah, dis stuff? I fix it for you, man. Won't take no time.
Is not enough to cover charges here.
Yeah, we done then. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Thank you, and no forget your change. Is pleasure to deal with the good side.
I do best to have it ready for you, as soon as I can.
Maybe next time you find something you need.
Think you forgot something here.
Hey, man. There's only one of me.  You leave some now, and then some more later.
You a crazy dog!
I closed 'til the shooting stop.
It's too dangerous to talk to you. You're not liked in Grumm. People will talk.
You're a hero around here. It will be joy to serve you.
Better now... I better now.
Hey, I say quick service, not magic! I want to do good job! You come  back in a bit, and maybe it be ready.
I be closing up now, so if you don't mind, it's time for you to go. You can come back tomorrow, if you like.

Let me introduce myself. I'm Doc Koolhan, the affordable and dependable licensed medical combat practitioner.
I like to get to know my patients.
War... such a terrible necessity.
I did not come here to make... acquaintances.
I do not care for this.
I'm kind of tied up at the moment.
Be cautious!
This was not part of my plans.
I shall need to address my wounds.
I'll have to leave.
I am most grateful.
Searching for medical services?
Secure my services.
The question of payment comes to mind.
One would think my medical abilities alone would warrant a more... persuasive offer.

You displayed the required composure to bring it all together. Well planned!
*sigh* I could sure use something to drink.
It will be a routine operation.
It will be a routine operation.
However...
We haven't much time.
It looks like we might have paid far more for the equipment than it is worth!
It is most unfortunate. We have failed!
That would serve little purpose.
They shall wish they had killed me!
Be cautious. We must watch our step.
We are halfway there, gentlemen!
For the moment, everything seems acceptable. However, I must allow others the opportunity to engage my services.
I am most grateful.
Specifically, how.
Sorry...

I remember when this place was called Grumm and there was work for all.
The Grumm mine is no more, it closed when the gringos changed the town's name. 
I miss the mine, it was the only thing this place had going for it.
The new oil rig is south of here, just follow the muddy drilling waste!
Doran's coast is getting ruined by all the toxic waste the Gringos are spilling out there

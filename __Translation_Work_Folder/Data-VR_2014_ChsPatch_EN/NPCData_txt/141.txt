How is it you're still alive?
You're in a private facility in an independent country.
You have no business being here. Leave now!
Keep it! I'll take it after you're dead.
It'll never happen.
You're gonna die!
I don't scare easy. And I don't change sides!

Take your tail, put it between your legs, and call your mother.
Make yourself at home. This is where you die.
I've been waiting for this!

This is where your journey stops!

At IMP, we know the mercenary trade. We know the pressures you're under, and we know what it takes - advice you won't find at any candyass "pc" site. Our profiles are designed to elicit honest answers, accurate results and information you need to know. ±
² Why you need us: ² As professional armed "servicemen", you need psychological profiling (and sometimes counseling) to get ahead in your profession and to use your God-and-Smith-&-Wesson given talents to their fullest potential. IMP takes you there. ±
² What you get: ² IMP analyzes you scientifically. We look at your personality, your skills, your physical attributes ... right down to voice and portrait identification. You get a look at your character, an in-depth profile of who you are and what makes you tick (or get clocked). ±
² How much: ² WITH THIS SPECIAL EMAIL OFFER, you get it all for only $10,000! A savings of $5,000 off regularly advertised prices! ±
This is a *limited* offer by invitation only. ² Your SECRET Activation Code: ² XEP624 ±
Law Enforcement Agencies are requested to note that this is for entertainment only, and IMP does not (in any way that can be proven in a court of law - technically) supply actual mercenaries. ±
Good luck in Arulco
Just wanted to say that my thoughts are with you. Best of luck. Remember to seek out Miguel and deliver my letter to him. I'm sure you'll find him invaluable. ±

You may also have a tendency to procrastinate. ±
FOR ONLY $10,000 we'll tell you a lot more about your character! ±
This is your last chance! (ok, not really, but pretend it is) ± ± Visit IMP now, and use your ² SECRET activation code: ² XEP624 ±

Inquiry
You do not know me, however, I have been informed that you are in a position to help me. I wish to avoid divulging details of my predicament electronically, and wonder whether you can meet with me at your earliest convenience. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
Follow up
Further to our discussion last night, I find your terms agreeable. I will need a couple of days to raise the money. While I am doing so, I trust you will be looking into my story, and we shall be able to conclude our deal shortly. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±

Great news
I was happy to hear Miguel Cordona is alive and you have made contact with him. Please tell him I have never forgotten what he did for me and that I would have returned sooner had I the money or the means to do so. ± ± Thank you for keeping me abreast of the operation. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
RE: Progress
From what I understand, it seems you have established a foothold in my country. It is a start, a commendable one, considering who you are up against and how long she has had to fortify her position. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
Keep up the Good Work
Your message was most encouraging. I am finally beginning to accept that this cause is not hopeless. Do not misinterpret what I mean. I have always believed in you, otherwise I would not given you everything I owned. However, after all these years, it is hard to believe that Arulco may be freed. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
The Final Push
I could not have received better news. I urge you to push forward and resist the temptation to celebrate prematurely. Until Deidranna is removed from power, no man can rest. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
RE: Setback
I trust you will recover from this setback. The news, though distressing, I hope will only serve to strengthen your resolve. Deidranna is a formidable opponent, of that, I am well-aware. Do not despair. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
Bad News
Do not allow your confidence to waiver. The situation is temporary. It was only a matter of time before Deidranna's forces made the necessary adjustments. ± ± I have faith in you and your team. ±
Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
Most Troubling
I must say, it is hard to believe such a beast exists. However, if they do, I have no doubt that Deidranna is somehow behind them. I trust our arrangement includes their removal from the country as well. ±
I wish you luck locating the source of these beasts. ± ± Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±

Yours Truly, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
Getting Worried
You must understand that the needs of my people are urgent. Their suffering immeasurable. For every day that passes under her rule more innocent lives are lost. I beg you to consider a more aggressive course of action. ±
Thanking you in advance, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
I am growing impatient. Had I known you were this cautious I would have hired someone else. Your lack of initiative is unacceptable. I regret that my poor judgement has once again caused my people to suffer. ±
A terribly disappointed, ± Enrico Chivaldori ±

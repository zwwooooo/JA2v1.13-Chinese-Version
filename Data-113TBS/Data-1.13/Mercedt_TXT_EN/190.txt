Seem one!
I got a bad guy here. It's looking pretty easy to waste him.
Bad guys closin' in!
Seem one!
What? I may be a mercenary, but I ain't crazy!
This place has kinda lost its charm, you know what I mean?
Watch out.
I smell victory. We got a real crack at winning this!
Watch out! I don't like the look of things around here.
They must have heard us coming!
Got bad guys, occupying my time!
I see something here.
I see something here.
Outta ammo!
I'm dying... I need a doctor, quick!



I'm not sure of myself.
My gun won't fire!
I'm being shot at!
I'm burned.
Lucky me.
It will be tough.
I think I'm bleeding.
I'm burned.
Aaah!
Batter up!
Batter up!



I figure you got screwed in the draft!
Good God!
I feel just like I'm sitting on the bench again.
Success!
I don't think so.
We did it!
I'm still having flashbacks! Sends a chill down my spine every time I remember it.
You just can't trust that guy. He'll take you any chance he gets!
You're not even trying to look good! You're an embarassment!
You change your team more often than I change my socks.
Good God!
I can't seem to get this thing working!
Major League team wants to give me another look! I just wish it wasn't the Cubs.
Yeah, I always wear a jock, it's a professional habit.
I'm sure you'll be happy with my potential. Everybody says I got a lot of potential.
We're gonna have to forfeit this mission.
We struck out!





You got money problems. You might wanna see if Reuban's available.
He's not messing around!
Taking fire! Taking fire!
I knew I wasn't the right guy to ask.
You like baseball? You catch the game last night?
When do we get to see your Major League stuff?!
If you're planning to use our overconfidence against us - we're prime!

This is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time!
You're outta here!
Don't worry. It's not a problem. I get sent down all the time.
That team's outta the game!
I kinda wish my agent was here.
We cleaned up this area pretty good!
Seem one!
We're the champions!
If they were all this easy, I'd give up baseball!
I'll let you know.
Were you guys planning on leaving me behind?
I thought I told you.
I can't seem to get this thing working!
I don't wanna touch it. It gives me the creeps.
Watch out! I don't like the looks of the ground!
I can't stay afloat much longer... No breath left...
I hope we didn't box ourselves in.

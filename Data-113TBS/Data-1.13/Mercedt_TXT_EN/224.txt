My brother's dead! I mean, like... He cried on my shoulder and everything.
My brother's dead! Like... My brother may have a couple of problems, but he took care of me while our dad was away in combat.

Like... I'm a little confused.
Like... This isn't good. My gun isn't shooting!
Like... There's shooting. And I'm, like, the target!
Like... I'm getting blood all over my uniform...
Finally, some luck!
Like... There's no way I could ever hit that!
Like... I'm getting blood all over my uniform!
Like... It wasn't easy!
Like... I usually don't have a problem keeping up, but I really, like, need a break.
Maxed out, parasite!
Maxed out, parasite!
I can't stand my brother Gary! Like, if you won't send him back immediately, I'll leave.


Like... It wasn't easy!
Oh, gross!
Like, I'm not very happy about this...
We rule!
And... Like we're not going to be chatting about it any more.
Like... Like we did it!
Amazing!
Like, unfortunately, I'm a Roachburn... And, like, I have no intuition at all.
Had I know it was going to be like... this dead, like, I would have worn black.
Okay... So, like, we're impressed.

Like, isn't purpose of money to buy things?
Like, I've been taking swimming lessons. And my instructor says that since I can almost dog-paddle, I'm going to be, like, moving up to junior dolphins soon!
Like, people say, I have a bubbly personality and everything... And I'm fun to be around... So, like, what do you think?
I'm, like, so excited...
Sorry, but, like... I'm seeing somebody already!
We aren't, like, going to be able to get the mission done, because, like, it's not possible.
Like, I don't even really consider Gary to be my brother!

Like... Larry's my brother, like... I never see Larry, unless of course he needs money.
My brother Larry is, like, having some personal problems right now.

Sorry... but, like, I can't stay! I'm a team player... and, like, I don't see any signs of a stable team here.
Okay... So, like, we're impressed.
Like, I needed that.
Like... I tried... And, like, normally I do it easily.
Like, it's been really nice chatting with you, but, like,  I'm outta here!
Like... I'm not very happy about this!
Like... Is there anyone in charge?

Like... That looked really painful from here!
Finally, some luck!
Like, I'm not very happy about this... It's, like, I haven't even started, or anything.
Like... There's no more of them!
Like, the price we paid sucks!
Maxed out, parasite!
I'm outta here...
Like, I sorta had fun working with you. And, like, doing it again would be awesome.
Finally, some luck!
Like... I usually don't have a problem keeping up, but I really like need a break.
Like... It's on there real good!
Like, I've said.
Like... This isn't working well. Like... This isn't working at all!
Like... This thing is set to really hurt somebody!
Let's be totally attentive... Like, this could be a minefield!
Help... I need help... Like... I don't know how to swim!
Like... I'm there already.

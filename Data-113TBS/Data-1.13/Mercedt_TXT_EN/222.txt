Got a reptile!
I could kill this reptile without being seen.
Encountered some renegades!
Got a reptile!
I tell ya! You run into family in the strangest places.
It can happen to anyone.
I hear a green platoon...
It's gonna be dangerous!
It's gonna be dangerous!
I'm the only Roachburn for the job.
C'mon!
Something here!
Something here!
Get me ammo now!
Ain't gonna make it! Blood everywhere... Make sure my kids don't get a damn thing!
Sorry Sammy... Old Sammy's been knocked off, huh. Well... We better win this thing in his honor!


I'm lost!
Jammed gun!
What the hell are you doing?
That's gotta be rough on the pacemaker.
Can't believe my luck.
I could save a bullet and wait for a better chance!
Bleeding here!
I can't go... I got a kidney stone!
When do you get to rest in this man's army?
Chew on that, lightweight!
Chew on that, lightweight!
Blooming dogfish... You're worse than Larry!
Blooming dogfish... You're worse than Larry!

I should have done this years ago!
Not too shabby for a rusty, old man!
I'm lost!
Colonel Roachburn is back in business.
Orders like that ain't confidence builders!
Ah... Just like the old days... Moments worth savoring!
If you're looking to hire a Roachburn, I'm the only Roachburn for the job!
I'd have made love with your mother, but I didn't have the exact change!
The indecisiveness of the incompetent!
Since you're paying me a good buck, I'll tell you few tales...
Now would be an excellent time to raise the pay out on your life insurance!
They don't make these things like they used to.
Apparently... word hasn't gotten around yet. You made the only offer.
Just don't compare me to my kids... Heck, I don't even know if they are my kids. Their mother was a tramp. She was raised in a trailer. A tent trailer!
Feels great to be back! I never shoulda retired.
Orders like that ain't confidence builders.
The last time you did that I woke up with a severe rash!
I can't stand my kids! They're always looking for money or causing me grief. They're just like their spoiled little mother!
I cant' think of a better way to put some distance between me and my family. They all drive me nuts!
Sam and I go back at least thirty years.


What do you figure? I'm gonna take a check for the difference? Come on! I wasn't born yesterday. I got back taxes to take care of... What would you do?
After I kill you, ligthweight, I'm gonna mount your head just above the fireplace! You'll like it there! You'll have a great view of a lake!
God... I hope it passes soon!
Blooming dogfish... 
I man has gotta have his pride, you know.
It's combat time!
It may look peaceful, but it won't last!

Now would be an excellent time to raise the payout on your life insurance!
You're just a kid, aren't ya?
What I do wrong?!
Platoon annihilated!
And if they keep paying through their nose for new equipment, they're going be looking for a new line of work.
There was a time when I thought we could work this out, but you're just a lot of smoke!
C'mon!
It was good to get back into the swing of things. I'd probably be up to doing it again, if you needed me.
Looks like it's my turn to pay!
Don't hold back.
Colonel Roachburn is back in business.
I can't believe the response.
They don't make these things like they used to.
It's coming down to the wire. Better watch the clock!
Whoever attempted to boobytrap this area did a pitiful job at covering their tracks!
I'm losing strength... Feel weak... I can't swim anymore...
It would make my day...




What do you think you are? Family?
What do you think you are? Family?




I can't stand being around my kids. They all drive me nuts! Do something about it, or I will.

I got an enemy sighted up and ready for a box!
I've got an enemy in sight! Still hasn't seen me.
I've got my hands full here!
Spotted one!
Spotted one!
Well well!
I'm not sure about this... Something's wrong.
Well well!
You should order more body bags!
I don't feel much like it.
I've got my hands full here!
I see something here.
I see something here.
I need some lead. And I need it now!
Need help... I'm fading fast!
Mike... Mike... Answer me, Mike... Ah geez!



Crap! My gun won't fire!
I'm taking heat here! I want to build a little fire of my own!
We got screwed bad!
They got screwed bad!
Nobody could make that shot from here!
I'm bleeding...
I'm out of here...
I'm out of breath...
Kiss my rifle butt!
I wish they were all this easy.
Killing Larry will get me back into my old man's good books.


Mike... Mike... Answer me, Mike... Ah geez!
I've been luckier.
You're going to be sorry you messed with me!
I knew with me around... The job would get done.
I don't do that kind of thing!
You deserve it!
Kiss my rifle butt!
I'm gonna make this guy sorry he ever messed with me!
We made out like bandits!
Is this the best you can do?
This place is going to blow!
This thing's a piece of garbage! Doesn't anything work around here?


Consider yourself lucky...
Get your hands off me!
That can't be right!
Lookie, lookie! It's my loser brother, Larry.

Mike's my idol!


We tried to work it out. Didn't happen... Don't bother me anymore.
Crraaap...it's Mike. I don't want to do this... Mike's my idol!
I'm taking it here!
I'm not good at this kind of stuff!
You're in the right neighborhood.
You can open your eyes now!
I think we got the last one around here.

Kiss my rifle butt!

With me in charge, you can count on it.
Ya... We did it!
I'm a little concerned...
She's DEAD?
Well well!
With me on your side, they didn't have a chance!
That's one group less.
Don't bother me anymore.
It's your lucky day. We're on!
I should have brought a book.
This thing is a piece of garbage! Doesn't anything work around here?
This locale looks suspicious..
The ground looks suspicious.
I can't breathe... I'm DRO...WNING!
I'll have to get more specific directions!

I'd never join up with someone І like you!
Forget this... You're not taking me serious enough.
You're a loser!
I'm outta here! You can't even get a decent haircut for that kind of money.
Well... Well... Busy, busy! I've got too many options. I'll join up with the team willing to put up the most cash, right now!
It wasn't that bad working for you. I guess if you need my services again you can call.
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm І out of here!


Your amount was matched. We'll go again. This time make me proud!
Fortunate for you, money is tight right now... So, I'll take it!
I'll join even though you don't deserve me!
I'm a little concerned. Mike says you're quick with the axe.


What about the money you already owe me? You give me three times what you you owe up-front and I'll go back!
Try listening...
You're stiffing a Roachburn! I thought you might want to be aware of that!
You stiffed a Roachburn, and now that I have the money... This Roachburn's stiffing you!
You're not even worth listening to anymore!
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm І out of here!


I'm a little concerned. Mike says you're quick with the axe.


Try listening...
Had you really wanted me, you would have bid a little higher. So, too bad!
I'm the best man for the job!
My father wasn't badmouthing me, was he?
I've got a bigger mouth than my father, and I'm a heck of a lot younger.
How you planning on paying me?
Don't bug me no more!
I don't work with my brother, 'anything but a placebo' Larry!

It's a good possibility. I'll need some time to weigh all my options.
You seem to be a little quick with the axe. I want double my regular salary!

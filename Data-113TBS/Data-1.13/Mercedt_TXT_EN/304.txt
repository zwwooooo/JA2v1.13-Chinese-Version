The hordes keep coming! 
Look - it's alive! 
Oh, we're in for a slaughter now!
Ahh, a creature.
Impressive, I suppose, but it's nothing compared to the power of Death! 
The forces of darkness are way ahead of us. As always. 
Who, or what, is that? 
I sense something strange about this.
Doom lurks all around us. 
What a delightfully gloomy place. 
By the seven hells, be careful! 
Look there!
What could that be? 
I have nothing to fire. 
Death...waits for me... 



Zoned out for a second. Run that by me again.
Now what is this devious device for? 

I'm afflicted!
Not yet. 
Out of reach!
Is all this blood mine?
I must rest in the arms of Sleep. 
My insides churn like the black pit. 
Death has taken him. Lucky fellow. 
Who's my next victim? 




How completely, utterly awful. 

Mission complete!
That was nothing but a feeble lie.
She has escaped into sweet oblivion. 
By the black pit, yes! 
He seems like a kind, generous soul. I hate him.
Ah well, Death waits for us all. 
Ah well, Death waits for us all. 
By the seven hells, do something! 
I hate going into battle with stuff I can't trust. This is the flimsiest crap I've ever been asked to use.


Beware! My power grows stronger! 
Gotta be kiddin' me. Wanna do WHAT?
Didn't really expect that to work, didja?






By all the powers of darkness, this is a fine situation to be in! What is this place? Where are we? 
All is darkness! 
The very hordes of hell could not do it. 
A sensitive soul. I understand his point of view.
This will be a beautiful battle. 
They are near... I can sense it. Let's finish this once and for all!
Ah, how exquisite! 

Ahh, magnificent. 
If I leave this place, I suffer the torments of the dammned! The only way to stop it is to destroy her.
Why has Death taken them, and not me?
We've been short-shipped or finger-slipped! Either way, there's stuff missing.
A magnificent kill, if I do say so myself! 
Ahh, a creature!
More proof that Death conquers all. Now let's get moving, before Death conquers us!
Death should be welcomed, not feared. 
Grabbing a catnap 'fore I smack my head off the floor.
Yup, I'm back on it.
Yes, yes...
It's a fake!
Ohh, it's booby trapped!
By the seven hells, a trap! 
I'm going down... fast!
That was worse than a journey through the seven hells and back.

There's one!
I've located one! Haven't been noticed.
I might need help here!
There's one!
There's one!
I've located one! Haven't been noticed.
Humm... Smells of porfume!
I've located one! Haven't been noticed.
The soil seems awfully fresh around here!
I wish that hadn't have happened!
I might need help here!
I found something over here.
I found something over here.
Urgent! Urgent... I need ammo!
Losin' lots of blood... I can't get up!




I'm in trouble... My gun's not working properly!
I've been fired at!
I seem to be bleeding!
Must be my lucky day.
I don't have much of a view.
I seem to be bleeding!
I feel faint...
I feel faint...
Don't take it personal...
I did my best!
Since Pops's been here, he hasn't left me alone. If that pervert isn't gone by morning - I will be.



This is the scariest time. The anticipation can be overwhelming.
Can't find my way!
I'm proud to be working for you.
That makes no sense.
I did my best!
I did my best!
What planet are you from?
Was it something I did? Something I said? I thought everything was going fine!
Maybe you should just surrender?
I've gotta get out of here!
It must be broken... Because I can't get it to work.
I hear things aren't looking too good for you.

Sort of reminds me of high school!


I left because Pops can't keep his hands to himself. And as long he's there, I won't be going back!




Why me? Are you doing this because I'm a women?


I try to help any way I can.
I expect to be shown some respect!
Looks like we lucked out and pulled an easy one!
I can't believe...

Hope you're paying your mercs well!

While I consider my last assignment with you an experience, it's not one I particularly want to repeat.
That should be one less group to worry about!

I did my best!
Running into problems!
It was hairy, but we did it.
I've had tougher vacations!
I feel faint...
I hope I was of some help.
This one can be ours! Let's keep our heads.
It must be broken... Because I can't get it to work.
There's something about it that makes me leery.
There's something about it that makes me leery.
I won't be able to tread water for much... Need help right away!
We came through!

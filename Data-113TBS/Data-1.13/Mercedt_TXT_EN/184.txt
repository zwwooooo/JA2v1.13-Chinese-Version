I think I see someone.
I think I see an enemy. I might be able to shoot him from here.
I'm in hot water here!
If I stay quiet, I could surprise him.
My eyes are playing tricks on me!
I got to do something about this. It's been happening way too often lately.
I hope it doesn't mean what I think it means.
This area smells of trouble.
I get nervous when there's no action.
This area is a little unnerving.
I'm in hot water here!
I think I see something.
I better take good care of this.
Out of bullets. I need all the ammo I can get!
I didn't see it coming. They blindsided me. I can't hang on for ver long... Send help.
Carp has passed away. It would've been nice if someone could've played pipes in his honour.


Must have overlooked something.
As if my aim wasn't enough of a problem, now my gun's not firing!
I hear shots! They're coming awful close!
I can't go much further... without taking... a break.
Take my heart miss a couple of beats!
A chance is extremely slim.
I think I'm bleeding.
I could use a rest.
I can't go much further...
Farewell!
We got one!
The Fox is nothing but trouble. Either you ship her out of here, or I'm shipping myself out.


I was hoping for more.
Your mother was a cheap date!

We've done it.
It is not possible!
This mission's over!
I have a feeling that was the last of them.
You've been warned.
There's far too many mercenaries dying down there.
I don't think you're capable of pulling off a succesful mission.
We have run into major snag!
Zis thing seems to be broken.
Women have no business being in combat!
I'm sure I can help you out - but I hope you realize my aim has been a little off lately.
I want to make sure you haven't overlooked my inconceivably strong mechanical skills.
We have run into major snag!
You have established a reputation for failure.
Women have no place in the military. Especially Fox. She's causing nothing but problems. I am leaving!

It will be great! My old chess buddy Carp signed on with you.


I've listened to your pity attempts at working things out far more times than I care to remember.
This guy could only stand still, I could finish him off.
I've been having some difficulties with my eyes.
I can't pry it.
You sure smell nice.
Are you scared?
Where did everybody go?

I'm half blind, and we're still creaming you!
I'm sure I can help you out.
This is a treatment I get for having a minor handicap?
I don't believe there's anyone left in that group!
Saying we paid too much would be an understatement.
It'll do.
Yikes!
We put in a good mission!
Just where did you do your training?
Things have been pretty slow lately.
I shall be working for you.
I believe I've mentioned that.
Zis thing seems to be broken.
There's something suspicious about it.
There's something suspicious about it.
Help me! I'm going underwater!
We should get going.

I spot new victim.
Enemies? Good. They will die quickly.
Our enemies are strong. Let me handle it.
Is a beast here.
Urgh. Disgusting.
What is this. These bodies here, who killed them?
Someone is coming.
Now, what is this for, I wonder...
What a delicious game of cat and mouse.
Hello? Anyone there? Hmm. It seems that this place is as quiet as a tomb.
These things come from everywhere!
Look, an item.
Valuables.
I need ammunition.
I am missing bodyparts.




I am starting to take this personally.
This is not a good place.
I have an affliction.
Not even close.
Can't reach.
My wounds are beginning to slow me down.
I rest. Or I become... upset. Understand?
I do not feel well..
Who wishes to die next?
I prefer fresh blood to fresh air.



So much for the dark savant. Awww. Where will I find a worthy opponent now?
Death is better enjoyed as a spectator sport, I think.
Giv me a knife and I will prick my finger. I think the story should be written in blood.
Finished. Let's get new mission.
I am killer, not carrier.
What a shame it had to end so soon.
That one put up a bit of a fight.
Lying pig!
This is not my idea of excitement.
This outfit needs a better class of mercenaries, not these bottom-of-the-barrel jackal wannabes.
Air assault! Watch out!
Ha! It's worthless piece of junk.
I kill in darkness before.
Who is missing? Somebody's gone?
I think I am getting better. Good.
I think I could certainly come up with a better course of action.






I need to wait. I'm still not sure how this is going to work out.
So, that is the dark savant. Well well. This is a most historic occasion. He has just met his killer. Me.
Aaaaaaaaah!
This is absurd. A man is required for this.
A very distuingished gentleman. I only hope he is telling the truth.
The enemy will die... slowly.
We must be careful.
This we will definetely keep.
Nothing satisfies like the taste of blood.
Ah, clever little fellow. Do not turn your back on this one.
It seems our enemies have joined forces.
Ah, the power of chaos! Their blood is ours.
There will be trouble because of this.
Our guest is dead. What a pity. Now, how shall we dispose of the body?
It is capable of much great work but also, much destruction.
So this is what the end is like. How... envigorating.
These men in here all died to keep this safe. How impressive. We can only hope to die so well.

Not so bad now.
Frankly, I'm in the same boat.
How sad.
Ah, a trap. It looks quite deadly, too.
There is something hidden.
*drowns*
We should scout the area and determine where we are.




There is something I must do. I will join you in a few days. Do not worry.
You've reached my video voice mail. Leave me a message. And Gumpy, if this is you, leave another message like the last one, and I'll send you a reply that explodes on impact. I'm not kidding.
If I can do anything else for you, just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?



My guess was right and my time well spent.
There will be many implements of destruction at my disposal, ja?




That is not possible.


You're serious? Okay. It's your funeral. I'm checking out.
I cannot function with this blood everywhere.










Do that again and I'll have your head!





*grins* A steep price to pay.

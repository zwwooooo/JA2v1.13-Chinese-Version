Got one, eh.
They're popping out the woodwork, eh.
Getting hammered, eh!
Got one, eh.
Maybe, uh, I should just blow it open.
That hurt, eh.
What, dude?
I... seem to be having a little trouble, eh.
Bad news, eh.
We gotta be finished soon, eh.
Getting hammered, eh!
Looks like there's something over here, eh.
Looks like there's something over here, eh.
How about some ammo, eh?
This ain't no joke, eh. I'm... bleeding like a goat here...




Bloody bullet's stuck, eh. I can't fire my weapon.
I'm being shot at over here, eh!
I'm sweating like a pig.
By the skin of my teeth, eh.
I can't even see 'em, eh.
Oh, god blood running down me, eh.
I'm still out, swollen up like a melon, eh.
I'm sweating like a pig.
First time, eh!
First time, eh!



Wasn't easy, eh.
So... who cut your hair, eh?

What do you want, eh?
Kinda stupid, eh.
I wish I could tell the difference but... she's dead? Must've just happened, she's still giving off heat.
You better hurt, eh.
What a looser.
I've had enough. You're just playing with me, eh.
We're pretty great, eh?
I... seem to be having a little trouble, eh.
Like... you're too cheap, eh.
You must be capricorn, eh?

The next offer better involve money printed on paper.
I hope it's the right thing to do, eh.
That was no deal. We got taken to the cleaners, eh.





I don't think money's gonna change anything, eh.
Oh, we're really scared over here, eh.
It's like I'm seeing you in a whole new light, eh.
I gave it a shot, eh, but explosives are my specialty.
I like what you've done with your hair, eh.
I'm keeping quiet, eh. That way no one knows I'm here.
Where are they hiding, eh?
We're gonna have to get it back?

I wonder what's ese's doing here?
As far as the mission goes, eh, we are lucky.
He he, that's one bunch wiped out, eh!
Bad news, eh.
We've done what we had to do, eh.
Got one, eh.
The only thing left to do is... party, eh!
We almost done it, eh.


Oh, it's nice for you to inquire.
This thing's seen better days, eh.
Those jerks wired this thing, eh.
Slow, eh, on this loose turf. It's getting me the witties.
I... I'm gonna need help... I can't swim much longer!
Sorry for the delay, eh, but I'm all set now.

I don't mean to throw the last cupple of missions in your face but who wouldn't, eh?
Your guys have more led in them, er, than a pencil, eh.
Forget it, eh. Last time I signed with you, you canned me.
I just had my wisdom teeth out, eh.
Bad news, eh. Seems to be run on explosive experts.
I'd rather go back on social assistance than stay here and try to get in with working with a team that's changing all the time, eh.



Let me know how it turns out, eh?
Alright. Let's stick around for now, eh.
I can't wait to get there, eh.



I'm leaving, eh. I might come back when you shake this looser thing, eh.
I told you hosehead...
I'm gonna have to see the cash, eh.
See you hosehead. This kind of cash is going to get me one hell of a 'lonely man weekend', eh, he he.
Hey mister death, eh, I'm outta here.






I told you hosehead...
I'm gonna have to see the cash, eh.
I'm listening, eh.
All the guys like me, eh. I usually entertain them with a couple of tricks I know, eh, that make use of small explosions.
What's the deal, eh?
It's gonna be fun working for you, eh.
I get back to yous, eh.


You're gonna have to dig deeper, eh.
Bad news for you, great news for me, eh. If you want me to join, eh, it's gonna cost you more.

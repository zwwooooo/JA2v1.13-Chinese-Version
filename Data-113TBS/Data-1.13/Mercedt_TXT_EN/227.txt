I've come across an enemy.
I've come across an enemy. I don't think I've been noticed.
I'm risking my life for this! There better be something in it for me.
Holy cow!
Holy cow!
I feel nauseous...
And remember - if I hear anything, you'll know about it.
I'm getting a queasy feeling in my stomach. 
There's something about this area that doesn't seem right.
Do you think I should get any special health insurance? And what about vaccinations? What about those tropical malaria beetles?
I could get really hurt!
There's something useful here.
Finding this thing should keep people off my case for a bit.
I'm in danger! I need ammunition!
I'm dying. I'm... really... dying. Help!
Doctor Gloveless is dead? But... he's been taking care of me since I was nine!


My head is pounding away.
Now my gun won't work!
Oh God. I'm starting to feel sick. There's bullets flying everywhere!
My head is pounding away.
That was too close for comfort.
My view's obstructed.
Oh no - I'm bleeding! I'm gonna die!
I could use the rest of the day off.
I'm seeing double!
Prognosis... Poor.
Prognosis... Poor.



Looks like you could've use a couple of more doctors!
This is gonna make me sick.
I'm not feeling right.
It's looking really good!
I won't even consider it.
I'm shaking lika a leaf. But we did it! We should think about heading home.
I won't sleep tonight. I don't know if I'll ever sleep again! All I know is I got to get out of here!
I wanna hurt him real bad.
You don't show enough loyalty!
Won't put up with you stiffing people much longer.
Holy cow! I could get really hurt!
This is one sad piece of machinery. It ain't never gonna work!
Well... since you asked... I've just had a bad bout of something worse than I ever had before and they gave me wrong meds, which caused me to suffer further complications-
It's a scar! A fifteen three-quarter inch scar from the time I nearly died. Took a hundred and eighty three stitches. It brought me back twice.
You can't buy more loyalty for your dollar! Hurl E. Cutter - where the "E" stands for "exceptional value"!
That'd be insane!
This is disappointing. I thought we have a chance.


Doctor Gloveless has my full medical history. You get on the bad side of my doctor - you get on the bad side of me.


Hey! You still owe me money! If you think I'll work for you, you're crazy.
Please! Don't hurt me! I'll tell you where everyone is!
I... have something in my eye!
You're crazy!
I'll need to see your test results.
There's an enemy present!
Anyone still alive over there?
Finding this thing should keep people off my case for a bit.
I always wanted one of these!
Alright!
Why me? When you wanted to know something about the team - wasn't I willing to tell you?
Chalk one up for us!
That arms dealer pulled a fast one! We got third degree burned!
It's a shame... Oh well.
Holy cow!
I picked up an unfamiliar rash, but other than that, it wasn't too bad.
That's one less gang that can hurt me!
I haven't slept since I left. Not a wink!
I feel good. I'm ready!
I've already told you.
This is one sad piece of machinery. It ain't never gonna work!
I could lose a body part messing with this!
The earth looks pretty dug up around here.
Oh my God... I'm drowning... I'm gonna die...
We're going to have to make some decisions.

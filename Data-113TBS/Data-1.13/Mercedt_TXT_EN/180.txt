Sniffed out a god-damn turd fly!
This guy's a sitting duck!
These god-damn turd flies are swarming around here!
Prepare to suck that, turd fly!
Got a sitting duck here!
It's god-damn disgusting.
Stay awake guys.
It passed every line of good taste.
Stay awake guys. This place doesn't seem safe.
You gotta be kiddin'!
These god-damn turd flies are looking to let some damage on me!
Found something.
Found something.
God-damn! I need ammo!
Need a medic... fast! I've gone and got my god-damn butt blown away!



Eh, I'm unsure of myself?
God-damn gun is plugged!
If anyone nearby can help me out, I'm in the midst of the hot one here!
Can I stop for a god-damn minute?
God-damn, there's someone shootin' at me!
You're not serious.
God-damn! Blood's pouring out of me!
I bet nobody would even goddamn notice if I took a nap.
God-damn...
Just try that again!
Just try that again!
"Ears" Stockwell's god-damn, warm-water, pond scum. You should have never hired a lowlife! You wanna keep me, I better not see him again.


God-damn. Of all the mercenaries to stick it to, why stick it to your buddy?
God-damn.
Does it never rain?
It took god-damn long enough.
You gotta be kiddin'!
God-damn! Mission accomplished!
This thing is finally over.
Leave it alone, fruit-loops!
You got one last chance to win the mission.
We're merceneraries, not god-damn seamen. We expect to be buried in the god-damn ground.
You gotta be kiddin'!
This is a piece of trash I'm holding here!
This is totally out of character for me - but I'll tell you what's happening...
It's a god-damn living.
You found the right man for the job!
You made a great choice, I just want to see if anyone else is as god-damn smart as you are.
Did you think what you did would go unnoticed around here?
"Ears" Stockwell's a maggot! A god-damn disgrace to the profession! I can't work with him.




How about the cash you were supposed to pay me? Did you think I would forget about it?
He's gonna blow the whole goddamn place!
God-damn!
It's a god-damn shame, but I was never very good with my hands.
God-damn! You're more gullible than I thought.
Stay awake! Somebody's loaded these fields with god-damn danger.
It'd be a god-damn shame, if we lost this now.
This should get me in tight with the boss...

This should get me in tight with the boss...
I tried to help you out. I tried to get in with the guys. Look where it got me! Don't waste my time anymore.
I think we knocked off all of that team!
Goddamn, did we ever land a deal.
Consider it... taken care of.
Prepare to suck that, turd fly!
God-damn, we're good. That was one hell of a performance!
Stick to cleaning helmets gear, Jackie!
We'll start fresh tomorrow, like nothing ever happened.
I'll have to catch up to the team.
Didn't I tell ya?
This is a piece of trash I'm holding here!
It's a goddamn booby trap!
Wanna see this.
I don't know how much longer... I can keep my head above water!
It took god-damn long enough.

Watch out! A bad person!
This stranger does not see me.
There's baddies!
It is unbelievable.
I really don't wanna touch you.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Something really weird is going on!
Something really weird is going on!
I'm gonna look for a safer place.
Oh, don't believe everything you read in the newspaper.
Staying alive is awfully hard around here!
I see something.
I see something.
More bullets, please!
Say... goodbye to all the kids for me... I'm not gonna make it.



I'm lost without instructions.
My gun won't fire!
I don't want to become... extinct.
I've been bopped.
Somebody's trying to hurt me!
I don't think I can make it.
I've been hurt!
I'm really pooped...
That hurts.
Sorry...
Sorry...



No more mister nice Dyno for you!
Oh no! Not again!
I'm having a bad day.
We're all tied up, boys and girls! We're gonna have to do it again.
I'm stopping this, before I lose more self-esteem.
You deserve to be punished!
It was alright! But I still want my old job back.
I should stick up for myself more often.
Maybe I can find a job as a team mascot...
I hear the Pirates are looking for a new mascot.
I'm gonna look for a safer place.
I think it's broken.
I can't believe those idiots replaced me with a woman! Those kids were lying. Kids do lie, you know. Especially that short, little, fat kid.
Those idiot producers are going to change their mind, and hire me back! I just know it! My replacement won't be able to have the job.
I'd say my greatest asset is my trustworthiness... I hope that's helpful.
I'm too scared to get fired again.
We'll never be able to do the job now.





You need help with your counting! You do not have enough money.
You're a one bad apple!
That hurts.
I thought I could make it.
I'll have to get back in touch with you.
Be alert! Remember the rules of safety, when walking through this area.
This is fun! I just love hide-and-go-seek!

Bigger numbers!
I think you should go stand in the corner, young man.
Well, ok. I have to expect getting fired sooner or later.
Wow! That wasn't too bad.
I think he made a lot of money of us.
A woman! I was replaced by a woman, wasn't I?
Here goes!
It is unbelievable! I went from nothing to all these people looking to hire me. Well, you have to know it's gonna cost you more.
If it was always as peaceful as this - I wouldn't mind this job.


For sure.
I think it's broken.
We should be real careful getting this, we don't want anything to go wrong.
Remember the rules of safety.
I'm drowning!
I'm lost without instructions.

Enemy present.
I made contact with the enemy.
I'm in a middle of the shootout!
Enemy present.
I couldn't believe my eyes!
Body's been here for a while.
They don't call me "Ears" for nothing, you know.
I find the whole thing rather repulsive.
I can't recall an assignement ever being this quiet.
This area looks like trouble.
I've flushed a couple out!
I can see something.
I can see something.
What a time to be outta ammo!
The pain... is unbearable... I need something... something for the pain.



Can't seem to find my way.
My weapon won't fire properly!
I'm coming under fire!
I'm exhausted. I've to stop for a second.
Someone just shot at me!
I haven't got much to shoot at.
I have a wound that needs attention!
It's getting late.
Can't seem to find my way.
Better you than me.
Better you than me.



It might be time to consider trade school! Or perhaps a degree in the arts!
Ah, should've been more careful.

We got the job done after all!
Hey! Wait a minute!
We've done it!
You have to love these piece of cake assignments.
I got nothing more to say to you.
Once was more than enough. Don't call me. Ever.
You just bought yourself one motivated mercenary.
I'm coming under fire!
I can't do anything with that piece of scrap.
I have a date. And god knows I haven't got one of those in a long time.
You may want to think twice about hiring Buzz Garneau. I hear she's with child. Seems... Lynx knocked her up.
Listen... I'm the best mole for the money.
I don't think we're gonna be able to get the job done.
You'd better get your act together.





You can't cover my cost.
I was hoping to see you again.
My eyes!
This is embarrasing!
It looks like we're dating steady.
I'm ready anytime you are.
That's quite a bag of losers you put together there, Commander Coward!

You're out of luck.
Lonely, eh? Tell me about it.
Perhaps if you gave me another chance, I could do better.
That's the last of that crew.
Made quite a profit off of us.
It's a shame.
Enemy present.
I was glad to be a part of it.
This sector should be under our control now.
Hang on a second.
Now...
Since you didn't hear me, I'll say it again.
I can't do anything with that piece of scrap.
Looks like a booby trap.
Ground looks like it's been camouflaged.
I'm exhausted. I can't find... strength to... stay afloat.
I've got it.

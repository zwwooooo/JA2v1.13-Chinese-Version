First I'll take from you your life! Next it is your dignity!
Now is the time to fight!
This is bad for us I think.
Look! Creatures over there!
So, we are stranded and lost in a strange place. This is the bad news. Here is the good news: we are not dead yet. One must always look on the bright side you know.
These bodies! I do not wish to stay here. Whatever killed them may be waiting for us.
Target please!
No one worth knowing I think.
Do not make any sudden movements.
Shh! I don't want them to hear me.
Is there machine making these things?
Look there.
That's for me.
Could I borrow ammo?
I'm afraid... of dying...



I surprise myself.
This one seems to be broken.
Go ahead, attack! I... will guard the rear.
What has happened to me?
Close does not count.
Out of range.
I am wounded, I think.
You all look so tired.
My legs! my arms!
Of course, it's simple for someone like me.
Take that!



I make it look easy.
I can say that I learned a great many things about life, like how lucky I am to still have it.
This... this is not a place for a lady.
The job. It is finished.
Not for all the money in the world!
At last!
That is a relief.
Lying is an art and this one was no master.
I didn't bring any bodybags.
I am not fond of military men. They have no sense of humor.
This will probably kill me.
You're joking, yes? I cannot carry that.
Cleverness is next to godliness, or something like that. Trust me.

Yes, it is about time I'm recognized.
Who's side are you on?
I'm not right woman for the job. There is, ah, no right woman for this job.






I think we look suspicious, standing around like this.
I'm allergic to blindness.
Sorry. These things happen.
How odd. But I suppose he knows what he is talking about.
Someone is here.
We miss somebody. Is not good sign.
We sell for lots of money, no?
I could get used to this.
You see?
If you're looking for someone to protect your interests I am the one. I have exellent credentials.
Don't forget to pillage the bodies!
Mind if I look for it?
We prop body against a tree and make like it's sleeping, ok?
Look what's coming!
The peace has finally been achieved.
Who are they fooling? They are weak.


Very sincere.
Ah, now what do you think this is for? Eh, who would like to try it out first?
I do not like the look of this trap.
Something hidden.
*drowning sounds*
Well, that's that.

Spotted a victim!
I could slither in behind 'em.
Got a couple of scumbuckets!
Rats!
Spotted a victim!
Rats!
Careful...
Rats!
Carefull! I'm getting bad feelings about this spot.
Once we get it back we can lay claim to this mission.
Rats!
There's something over here.
There's something over here.
I'm in a combat zone without ammo!
I'm bleeding real bad! I don't think I can move...
I am personally gonna take out whoever took my buddy, Ice, down.



My piece is jammed up!
I'm having trouble over here.
Man... Am I wiped!
Got a dupe tryin' to take me out!
I couldn't make that shot if my life depended on it.
I got nicked!
The heat was killing me anyway...
Man... Am I wiped!
This one's in the bag!
Scumbucket!



This one's in the bag!
Didn't miss by much!

That's what you call good work!
No way!
That ought to silence the doubters.
Scumbucket!
You're a chiseller...
Boy Scouts... Nothin' but teeny-weeny, Boy Scouts!
Didn't you guys get guns?
You used up all your luck!
This is a poor excuse for equipment... It doesn't even work!


Hiss... Hiss... Cupcake!
Did you learn anything?
Did you learn anything?


My buddy the Iceman!


No! You really pissed me off!
I'm gonna fix ya, scumbucket!

I can't be good at everything.
You're pissin' me off!
Firing off a couple of rounds sounds pretty exciting right about now.
Remember to keep your head up and your eyes open out there!

Scumbucket!

They're gonna be sorry!
We've taken care of that group!

That ought to silence the doubters.
Scumbucket!
It's the right thing to do!
I think we just begged ourselfes another sector.
Man... Am I wiped!
Everything's a go!

This is a poor excuse for equipment... It doesn't even work!
This thing's got a detonator!
Careful... Chunks of topsoil are missing.
Swallowing water... Need help... fast...
Time's runnin' short.

No! If its one thing i wan't do - it's work for somebody who can't get it right.
I can live with working for someone else.
You hit the lotto, you get back to me!
It ain't good. I haven't got time!
I'm really tempted to jump on it, but I'll play it smart and wait it out. Could be some other stuff happening. I'll be in touch!
You can call me anytime!



The dough's the same right across the board. I'm gonna give everyone another stab at it.
We got a unbelievable bargain!
I'll join!
Hey, if you're good enough for the Iceman... You're good enough for me.


There ain't much that sends me packing, but working for a loser is right up there! Maybe you'll be able to turn things around without me.
Get the wax out! I told you...
Thanks for the interest, but I gotta make a living.
And that's the end of the story!
I can live with working for someone else.



I'd hate to bag Ice... He saved my butt in Kampoa!


Get the wax out! I told you...
There's all kinds of stuff happening. I'm going with the team dishing out the most dough.
I'm the guy you want! Trust me!
Why do you think they call me Snake?
I packed it in with the Iceman.
I'll put my differences aside!
It still ain't good, but don't sweat it. We'll get together one of these days.


Hang in there! Things might turn around for you, too! See ya!
I'm interested... Interested in hearing a better offer.

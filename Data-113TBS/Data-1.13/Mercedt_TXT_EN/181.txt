Hi. I'm Carl. I'm thirty six. I'm single. And I own my own mobile home.

I'm cheap, and I'm sure good at opening crates!
I rented some movies. I haven't finished watching 'em all yet.
You know? I was almost a big star in the WWE, but I just didn't fit into those star-spangled shorts.
I'm taking the money, and staying right here. What do you gonna do about it?
Is it quittin' time yet?
Moses gets lost in the bathroom! I can't work with him.

Yup, I really like to work with Mike!


I can count, you know. You don't have all the money!
Mike ain't gonna like dis!

This is hopeless.
Dat's OK.
Come and get it!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

I want to try again.
Come on, you little chizzler.
It's time to head for home!
Those guys are all gone.
We sure paid a lot of money.
Chick looks dead. I mean - real dead.

I got the jump on this sucker!
I got some sewer snipe in sight! Lookin' to toast it!
Hell... I've been spotted.
Bastards!
Hell... I don't like this!
Hell... I don't like this!
Careful... Someone's been digging here!
Hell... I don't like this!
Hell... This place makes the Middle East look like a beach party. 
Hell... I guess it just wasn't our turn.
Hell... I don't like this!
I've eye-balled something over here.
I've eye-balled something over here.
Hell... I'm short of lead!
Been chewed up something bad! Hell... I'll be damn lucky to make it!
Hell! They took out Screw! Ya know down deep that guy's all heart.



Hell... What a time for my gun to jam!
Hell... You're playing with your life!
Hell... I'm leaking blood!
Hell! That was close...
Hell... I'd have to be real lucky!
Hell... I've done worse!
Hell... Stop for a minute.
Hell... I'm gonna pass out if I don't stop for a minute.
That's one troop down!
Expect the same, dirtball!
Hell, you've gone and brought that quack, Bernie, here? Either you send him packing, or I leave. It's bad enough I have to see him for my annual physical.


Say your prayers, slimeball... This one's from the Boss!
Hell... If I hadn't been there myself, I'd never believed it happened!
Hell no!
Hell ya! This mission's a done deal!
Hell no!
Say your prayers, slimeball... This one's from the Boss!
Say your prayers, slimeball... This one's from the Boss!

Hell... You can't be serious!
Hell... You're not even on my B list!

Hell... This thing is nothing but a piece of junk!


You picked a hell of time, snowball!
Hell... I bet once you learn how to load the weapons, you'll be real mean!
Hell... Do you have any credentials?
Hell, that looks like it may be doctor Gloveless. I can't be sure. I rarely get to see him from the front.

Hell... It's Screw. I guess... I'll need another beer buddy.


Hell... I haven't got time for this!
Have you lost your mind? Hell... This is the Boss you're sticking it to!

Hell... I haven't got any more time for this!
Hell... Forget I said anything!
Hell... This place makes the Middle East look like a beach party. 
Hell... This place makes the Middle East look like a beach party. 

Expect the same, dirtball!

Hell... I got nuthin' better to do, right now!
That was a job well done!

Hell... I heard you used to work at Dairy Queen!
Hell... I don't like this!
Hell... We sure showed them!
You can file this one under victory.
Hell... I'm gonna pass out.
All right!
Hell... What about me?
Hell... This thing is nothing but a piece of junk!
Hell... This thing's boobytrapped.
Hell... I smell a trap around here!
Phhhhhell... Swallowing water...
Hell... I'm already here!

Hell... This place makes the Middle East look like a beach party. If you want me to come back, you're going to have to get the body count down.
Hell... This place makes the Middle East look like a beach party. If you want me to come back, you're going to have to get the body count down.
Hell no! You're so disloyal, I doubt you could keep a DOG!
Hell no! The scent of death clings to you like Ð† a week-old shirt!
I have a good feeling about this. I'll let you know...
Hell... The excitement's killing me. We've got a tie. If you don't want it to happen again, go really big this time!
I worked with that quack, Bernie Gloveless, once. I don't ever plan on backing into him again.


Hell... I got job offers coming out of my whammy! The guy who drops the most cash on me gets me!
I gave you a fair shake. Hell... A man can't do any more than that!
All right... We got a hell of a deal!
Okay... I'm gonna overlook some of the problems I have with ya 'cause Screw's on your team, and I haven't seen him for a while.


Hell... I wish I could, but I got do a tune-up on my car!
I said...
Where the hell are you gonna get the money?
Hell... I was gonna quit anyway!
Hell... This place makes the Middle East look like a beach party. If you want me to come back, you're going to have to get the body count down.
Hell yeah. I know just where I'm gonna get that Gloveless.


Okay... I'm gonna overlook some of the problems I have with ya 'cause Screw's on your team, and I haven't seen him for a while.


I said...
And don't even think about reaching for your wallet!
Hell... You're looking at the best! I can build, fix and kill anything! I'm the Boss!
Hell... I never heard of you! You're gonna have to show me what you're made of before I'll join!
Hell... You didn't expect me to turn over the cash, did ya?
It's a hell of a way to make a living. On the upside, you get to travel a hell of a lot.
Hell... You enjoy hiring mercenaries so much, hire yourself another!  I quit!


Hell... It's almost time to wrap this up!
Hell... This is a waste of time. You can't even meet me half way!

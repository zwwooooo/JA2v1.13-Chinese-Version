Scumball sighted!
Got an easy kill over here!
I got a problem over here!
Scumball sighted!
Scumball sighted!
Got it over here!
I ain't gonna be sneaking...
Got it over here!
Everybody better keep their eyes to the ground!
I know about the crabs...
I got a problem over here!
There's something here worth checking out.
There's something here worth checking out.
I need more ammo now!
I'm hurting real bad! I need someone with the guts to shoot me...
Whoever killed my buddy, Boss, is gonna have to deal with me!



My piece is jammed!
Some idiot took a shot at me!
It ain't looking good!
I never even broke a sweat!
I could scare 'em, but I can't hit 'em!
Need a Band-Aid.
Break time!
You'd have to be a bloody camel to survive out here...
You're a dead man!
You're a dead man!
Gettin' to put a couple holes into Bob Adams is a dream come true!


Say your prayers, skippy!
I love watchin' 'em getting burned.
I hate this!
You gotta love it!
This is totally out of my control!
Say your prayers, skippy!
Say your prayers, skippy!

My kill rate's taking a beating here.
Better call your mom and tell her you won't be home for supper!
Prepare to become one with the earth!
I'm getting tired of working with this junk!
I'm not done yet!

Jackpot!
That wouldn't be smart.
That wouldn't be smart.
Well... Well... If it isn't the hotshot pilot himself!

Jackpot, Boss!!!


I've done far worse for less money...
Get out of my face!
I botched it!
I still can't make it!

This scumball's gonna get it.
Everyone had better keep their eyes wide-open around here!

Say your prayers, Skippy!

You should be feeling good right about now!
I can't smell them anymore! They probably all went home to their mothers!

Say your prayers, skippy!
Get out of my face!
We did what we had to!
They're outta here!
Break time!
You came up short!
Ain't no way!
I'm getting tired of working with this junk!
It's rigged to blow.
It's rigged to blow.
This is embarrassing! I can't believe... I'm going to dro..wn!
I haven't got the patience.

I can't work for you! Everyone in this profession is laughing at ya!
Working for you is dragging down my kill rate. I gotta find something with more potential.
It ain't gonna happen! I've already worked for ya! I wasn't impressed!
I can't work for you! Everyone in this profession is laughing at ya!
I'm getting plenty of calls. I'll have to give you a shout back.
You're deadbeat. Declare bankcrupcy and find yourself a job you can do.
I hear that airbag, Bob Adams, is on your team... I'll go, just so I can let the air out of him.


Time's a ticking!
We've saved ourselfs a few bucks.
You're the lucky winner.
Boss is on your team? Well... That makes a difference! I'll go, but I'll be keeping an eye on you!


Nothing panned out... I'm thrilled to be working for you.
I hate repeating myself, but...
You gonna rob a bank, Skippy?
I'm clearing out! We've become a joke!
I won't be going back! When I worked for you, my kill rate took a beating... Try Biff!
If you don't get rid of that airbag, Bob Adams, I'll get rid of him myself!


Boss and I started out together in this business. Hell... we've even shared tool kits!


I hate repeating myself, but...
You gonna rob a bank, Skippy?
My talent speaks for itself.
Whatcha looking at?
Whatcha waitin' for?
We're going into overtime and I've got big pockets!
Patience was never my strong point! Get out of my face!
Boss Hatchet told me to avoid you like the plague. He says you're on a power trip, and you're full of yourself!

Today's out! I don't owe you any explanations!
I got more offers than I know what to do with! All right, the one who puts the most cash in my pocket gets me.

Got a bad dude that's on to me!
Bad dude! Looking the other way.
This place stinks of rotting flesh!
Heads up!
Heads up!
Heads up!
I wouldn't think twice of it!
Heads up!
Heads up!
Our chances of taking this mission are zip!
This place stinks of rotting flesh!
I see something here.
I see something here.
More ammo! Make it quick!
Somebody get over here! I got some serious wounds...
I can't kill Magic! He's my friend! Of course, I'd get to console his wife...



The firing pin's stuck!
I'm takin fire!
I caught a bleeder!
I'm gonna need cover!
Gonna have to move if I'm gonna hit it!
I caught a bleeder!
I have to stop for a minute.
I have to stop for a minute.
This one goes to our side!
I'm messed up good!
It's gonna be a pleasure doing away with that showboat Lynx!


We got it done!
I'm messed up good!
No dice!
I'm done! Ready to roll...
Your command is pathetic... I ain't sticking it out with you!
I was framed! And I've repented!
We got it done!
I shouldn't have given him the chance!
You have any idea how many trees you killed?
Come on out... I promise I won't hurt you.
Heads up!
This thing is useless!
I'm in a better mood. I can wait another minute.

I'm in a better mood.
Whenever you want to start!
Listening to you has been a waste of time!
There's only one person I won't work with, and you signed him up. Ditch that showboat Lynx, or I'm outta here!

My man Magic!


Later loser!
Bad time to be cheap!

Sorry sweetheart... But when I finally get around to it, I'm going to do it right!

Heads up!
Where are they?

We got it done!

What can I tell ya? This stuff is usually a piece of cake for me!
That's one less gang to worry about!

We got it done!
Heads up!
I was framed! And I've repented!
You're joking, right!
I messed up.
Come again!
We understand each other!
This thing is useless!
It's set to take somebody's legs.
It's set to take somebody's legs.
I'm goin' under, man...
All right! We're on our way.

Offering petty amounts of cash doesn't take care of problems, it causes 'em!
No thanks! If I had wanted to die, I would have asked for the chair!
I appreciate the second chance, but I don't need it!
No dice! I didn't escape to get a weekend job working for you!
Looks good... I'm just gonna wait on a couple of calls, and I'll be talking to ya...
Give me a shout if you need me.
I don't work with Lynx!


Time's running out!
Yeah, you can count me in!
You got me! Can't say I'm disappointed.
I'll join... But only because my man, Magic, is workin' for ya.


No dice! I'll root for the underdog, but I draw the line at signing on with a known loser!
Like I already told you...
What do you think I am? An honest criminal? Kudos for the cash. We'll catch you another time!
I'm outta here... Before the grim reaper pulls my number!
No dice! Magic tells me you fire people for sport!
I quit! You don't keep your team tight enough! Straighten it out, and I'll think about joining up again.


Magic bought it? Now I'm really ticked!


Like I already told you...
This gets better all the time! We'll break the tie by you upping the amount of cash I get up-front.
Get the money, and we'll talk!
I wasn't in prison THAT long!
It was a racist, rogue cop! That's the only reason I got time. That...and no money for a defense team!
Things are too hot right now. I gotta keep low.
And you ain't wasting my time trying to buy your way around it.
I see they got Lynx on their squad.

I gotta stay put. The warden will give up soon enough.
This is the deal, I'm a popular man... The team offering the most cash gets me.

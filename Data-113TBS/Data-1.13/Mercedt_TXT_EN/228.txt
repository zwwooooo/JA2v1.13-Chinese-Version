I have spotted an enemy.
I have the upper hand. The enemy fails to see me.
I'm being attacked!

I have spotted an enemy.
Son of a bitch!
This isn't good.
Be cautious. We must watch our step.
Be cautious. We must watch our step.
I am deeply confused. This was not part of my plans.
I'm being attacked!
I spotted something.
I have spotted something.
This isn't good. I could use some ammo.
Pulse... is weak... and erratic... I'm... losing... consciousness...
Needle's passing has left the world short an excellent physician. Enough said.


I'm confused.
This gun is going to get me killed! It won't fire!
They shall wish they had killed me!
I shall need to address my wounds.
Most fortunate.
It will be difficult to hit from here.
I shall need to address my wounds.
*yawn*
*sigh* I could sure use something to drink.
One less problem.
That was most satisfying.



Perhaps your sister could be of some assistance!
It appears you're in way over your head!

We are off to a fine start!
That would serve little purpose.
It pains me deeply to see you suffer this way! Perhaps you have overlooked the benefits of a nutritional breakfast!
I am most grateful for the possibility to place this matter... behind us.
Perhaps your sister could be of some assistance!
War... such a terrible necessity.
I did not come here to make... acquaintances. You will have to learn to manage a stable team.
Be cautious. We must watch our step.
It looks like we might have paid far more for the equipment than it is worth!
Bought it in Jersey. It's a hundred percent cotton!
War... such a terrible necessity.
We are halfway there, gentlemen!
It is most unfortunate. We have failed!
I do not care for this.


Needle is friend, and fine medical doctor!


For the moment, everything seems acceptable. However, I must allow others the opportunity to engage my services.
It appears you're in way over your head.
Son of a bitch!
I tried, but I haven't a clue what I'm doing!
That was most satisfying!
Be cautious! We must watch our step.
I doubt it will remain this quiet for too much longer!
Most fortunate!
That was most satisfying!
I spotted something!
It will be a routine operation.
We shall not hear from them anymore.
Son of a bitch!
That was most satisfying!
I have spotted an enemy.
We achieved our mission. You displayed the required composure to bring it all together. Well planned!
We shall not hear from them anymore.
*yawn*
For the moment, everything seems acceptable.
And the matter is no longer open to discussion!
This seems to be malfunctioning.
I'm not comfortable handling this!
I'm not comfortable handling this!
*glug glug* Too tired...to swim... *gasp* Need help... now...
We are halfway there, gentlemen.

No. The way you manage your team, that would serve little purpose.
Sorry, but I like to get to know my patients. The way you manage your team, nobody seems to stay around for very long!
A longtime patient of mine has taken a turn for the worse. I'll have to leave.
Unfortunately, I haven't managed to free up any time quite yet.
Searching for medical services? Let me introduce myself. I'm Doc Koolhan, the affordable and dependable licensed medical combat practitioner.
My patience has expired. I shall be leaving!



We haven't much time.
Your offer is accepted.
We are off to a fine start. You were my first choice of employer, and your offer is accepted.
I shall put my differences with you and your history aside, simply because Needle is a competent physician and a pleasure to work with.


For the moment, everything seems acceptable. However, I must allow others the opportunity to engage my services.
I shall repeat...
I am deeply insulted by your frail attempt at bribery, and I do not wish to hear another!
I have allowed you ample opportunity to secure my services. You failed to take advantage of it, and now my patience has expired.

I'm Doc Koolhan.
...the affordable and dependable licensed medical combat practitioner.
Searching for medical services?
The question of payment comes to mind. Specifically, how.
I'll have to leave.


Unfortunately, I haven't manage to free up any time quite yet. I'm kind of tied up at the moment.
One would think my medical abilities alone would warrant a more... persuasive offer.

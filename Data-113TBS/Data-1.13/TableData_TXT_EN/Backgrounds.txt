273:BACKGROUND/szShortName:SWAT Team
273:BACKGROUND/szDescription:Blurring the line between police and military, SWAT teams are used&#10;in urban operations too dangerous for normal law enforcement. Since&#10;you're in the mercenary business now, it clearly wasn't dangerous&#10;enough for you.

285:BACKGROUND/szShortName:Black Bloc

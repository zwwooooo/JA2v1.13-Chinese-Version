612:ITEM/szItemName:AKMS
612:ITEM/szLongItemName:AKMS
612:ITEM/szItemDesc:Variant of the standard AKM. While making the gun more portable, the folding wire stock is not as stable or comfortable as standard wooden furniture.
612:ITEM/szBRName:AKMS
612:ITEM/szBRDesc:This version of the AKM comes with a spiffy folding stock. About as comfortable to put against your shoulder as a lawnmower blade, its compact size still makes it ideal for paratroopers, mechanized infantry, and anyone wearing a trenchcoat.

615:ITEM/szItemName:AMD-65M
615:ITEM/szLongItemName:AMD-65M
615:ITEM/szItemDesc:This AK copy is not the most stable firing platform, but the forward grip gives you some extra control when it's time to rock and roll.
615:ITEM/szBRName:AMD-65M
615:ITEM/szBRDesc:Despite being devoid of the trademark wood, this gun begs the question: "Does the world really need another Kaloshnikov knockoff?" Our answer is an emphatic "Yes."
616:ITEM/szItemName:AN-94
616:ITEM/szLongItemName:AN-94 "Abakan"

619:ITEM/szItemName:Veresk
619:ITEM/szLongItemName:SR-2 Veresk
619:ITEM/szItemDesc:In use with Russian elite law enforcement units, this SMG fires the same armor-piercing round as the Gyurza pistol.

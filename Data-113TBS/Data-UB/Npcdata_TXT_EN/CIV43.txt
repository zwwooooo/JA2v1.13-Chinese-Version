You are not welcome here.
The army will take care of you.
You have no right to be in Tracona.
Why are you here?
The people will resist.
You are a force of invaders.
Your intrusion will be reported.
What gives you right to be here?
This is independent country.
Remember, you are being watched.
It best you leave now.
Go back! Go back now!
You are hated. And unwanted.
You are in Tracona without authorization.
Soon! The army will come for you.

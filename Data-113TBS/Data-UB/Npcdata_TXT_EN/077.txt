My name Rudy Twoskidoo.
It big surprise to see ya.
Watch out for Deputy Commander Morris. He's very mean man.
Very hot here. Get sun every day.
Uh, I not allowed to take anything. Uh, they check my locker all the time.
You do not wish my friendship?
This is way Deputy Commander Morris speak to me. I not like it.
I am dove! I can kill nothing.
Ugh! Return my body to North... Will not find peace here.
I must go to work.
I will add it to pile I make for travel home.
You enemy of all men.
Kill soldiers! Not me!
I from far north. Come to Tracona to study power management and energy efficiency. Now I run whole plant. It big operation here. But I no like it. I learn quick. But they no let me go back home.
I miss sister and mother, Mary Onesewmachine. They are good people. Not like Deputy Commander Morris who run big rocket plant next door. This man no like me. He yell many times. Always want more power.
I hate him. He is wicked man. I think he make bad plans for big rockets. It be good you destroy them. And you destroy Deputy Commander Morris too. I get to go home to family.
It is good you come now. I will help you. Deputy Commander is wicked man. I think he make bad ideas for big rockets. It be good you destroy them. I go home, if he go away.
I know way to rocket plant nobody watch. Go by tunnel for big fan. It dangerous, but fan stop, every day for small time. You fast, you be in tunnel before it start. You slow, you get chopped like seagull in jet engine.
When fan stop it make alarm - maintenance alarm. When alarm stop, fan go back on. You go through fan and make big surprise for Deputy Commander Morris. You save me, and country from evil man.
I think you be gone by now. I hear fan alarm, I guess you no go in. I hope it still plan to go take care of Deputy Commander Morris.
It too bad you only see me now. I want to help get rid of Deputy Commander. Have secret way, but fan stop already for maintenance today. Maybe you hear alarm, too?
Only way to go, I think now, is to blow up fan with TNT. Make lots of noise. Everybody know you coming. Be ready for big fight. There may be many soldiers waiting on the other side.
It not custom to talk this way to new friends.
Thank you. I was ready to die. To find peace with ancestors.

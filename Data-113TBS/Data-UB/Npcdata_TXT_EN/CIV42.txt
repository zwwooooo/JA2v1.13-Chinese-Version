You're turn will come!
You will suffer worse than me. This is a promise.
Look what you have done. I am innocent civilian!
You are heartless!
You will be next to suffer.
Pain! The pain!
You sick soldier! I am unarmed.
You are worse than Satan.
Harming the defenseless. You must be proud.
Killing civilians... is... against international... law.
What kind of a soldier are you?
Ugh...They will hold a trial for you.
You are a cold-hearted killer... I was not a threat.
What did I do to you? Have you no mercy?
Why? Why... Why?

"I'm not a mercenary, but I play one on TV. IMP's quick and accurate profiling service gave me exactly what I needed . . . and expected!"
"While I found IMP's service tailored to the needs of the merc, technically we are still investigating their involvement in alleged illegal activities."

Can You Be Your Own Worst Enemy?
Should you just watch your back, or is there something else you should know about? Some little personality flaw that's going to take you down and out . . . At IMP, we know the mercenary trade. We know the pressures you're under, and we know what it takes--advice you won't find at any candyass "pc" site.

As professional armed "servicemen," you need psychological profiling (and sometimes counseling) to get ahead in your profession and to use your God-and-Smith-&-Wesson given talents to their fullest potential. IMP takes you there.
IMP analyzes you scientifically. We look at your specialties, your skills, your physical attributes . . . right down to voice and portrait identification. You get a look at your character, an in-depth profile of who you are and what makes you tick (or get clocked).
For only $3,000 (a savings of $2,500 off regularly advertised prices).
Once you have completed our survey, you will get immediate results. Additional follow-up information will be emailed to you in 2 to 3 business days, giving you further insight into your psychological profile.

Many mercs tend to find a specialty or side skill which they excel in. Usually these specialties result from a passion or interest. Take a careful look at the list that follows and see if anything relfects your area of expertise. ± ± For the purposes of this assessment, you are limited to two choices. If you identify strongly with any one particular skill, then refrain from choosing a second.
Additionally, if you feel none of the following choices apply to your situation, then simply choose the last option "None". This is just as viable a choice as mercs who haven't specialized in any particular field tend to have concentrated their energies on the more basic attributes or skills. ± ± Remember to be honest if you wish to benefit the most from this exercise.

When you were a kid, you most wanted to be:
Bruce Lee
Clint Eastwood
Rocky
Houdini
Terry Bradshaw
The President
You are waiting in line at a circus watching a punk teenager attempt to throw darts at balloons in order to win a prize. He misses the first three shots, and pays for more, apparently after a luxurious prize: a gold nose ring for his girlfriend. After watching him for 20 minutes, you grow frustrated. You have quite a bit of skill in this game. So, you:
Decide to offer him a bit of on-the-spot coaching and show him how to throw a dart properly.
Skillfully toss darts over his shoulder so that no one notices and he wins the prize.
Grab him by his chain-wearing neck and stick his concrete hard, pointy, purple hair spikes through the gigantic balloons he cannot seem to otherwise hit.
Kindly ask the game's other attendant if he could possibly spare a moment from his 12-pack so that you, too, could play.
You have just watched someone put $1,000,000 into a locker at a bus station. Amazed that he just walks away, albeit with the key, you find yourself in a moral dilemma. Thankfully, it does not last long. You:
Wait for the coast to clear, pick the lock and take the money.
Clear the coast yourself . . . Who cares? You've got a million bucks! Blow open the lock with your gun, walk coolly out of the building and grab the first blonde you happen to pass by.
Follow him. Under the cover of darkness, you ambush him and grab the key along with any other goodies he might be carrying, like keys to other lockers.
Call the police, sure that something illegal is taking place and hope for a small reward.
Suppose you owned a pick-up truck and lived in Tennessee. What is the most likely item to be displayed in the rear window?
Your rack of semiautomatic hunting rifles for those really aggressive deer.
A peace sign.
The Rebel flag.
A silhouette of a naked woman to complement those on your mud flaps.
A comical character with two big ol' guns and the words "Back Off!" in blood red letters.
A certain, annoying, pathetic, furry, purple dinosaur should be:
Held up as a loving role-model for children's morals and values.
Hung from a tree.
Hung from a tree and shot.
Hung from a tree, shot, gutted and run over by a Buick.
You are alone and asleep in your bed at night when you hear a sound downstairs. You are certain someone is breaking into your house. In the lingering seconds between awakening and your impending heart attack, you reach for the phone and call 911. What would you most likely do next:
Scream at the top of your lungs until your vocal chords feel like gravel.
Grab a knife and head downstairs after the intruder.
Stay on the phone and hide under the bed.
Realizing that you're trapped, you bolt out the nearest exit, even if that means jumping out of the second story window.
Grab your gun, begin blowing holes through the floor of your bedroom and yell, "Yeah, come on up and get some of this, Tough Guy!"
In the middle of a normal day in a large American city, you notice an army surplus store being looted. Thinking, with a decided lack of morals, that this must be your lucky day, you rush inside. There are, however, only four things left in the store. You grab one and rush out. Which one do you grab?
A brand new computer minus, of course, the necessary manuals.
A complete set of survival knives with the special "slicer and dicer" attachment kit.
Night vision goggles bundled with an illustrated guide, "Daytime: The Unnecessary Hazard."
Bob, the night clerk, who is wrapped in duct tape but otherwise okay.
You are applying for a job as a butcher. In an effort to give yourself the edge over other applicants, you:
Demonstrate that you can skillfully wield two blades at the same time.
Take a few liberties with your background, such as that high profile (and fictional) position you held as foreman at Bob's Slaughterhouse.
Show up well-dressed and confident that you are the perfect candidate.
Begin practicing prime cuts on neighborhood pets.
Your wife is three hours late coming home and hasn't called. You:
Didn't really notice.
Tell Candy there's no rush to leave.
Assume she is with someone else, no doubt a strapping 18-year-old young buck.
Pace back and forth in the living room until you wear a path in the carpet.
You live next door to a college frat house. Following weekend after weekend of loud and crazy parties, you:
Decide that, yes, you really are too old for this.
Really begin to doubt that your wife is having a Rubbermaid party for the boys.
Bribe your plumber to hook their septic tank directly into the C0-2 system, after installing several strategically placed "Guinness" signs.
Do nothing, fearing that calling the police would only lead them to do God-knows-what to your property.
Driving to work in your new sports car, you pull up behind a young man in a minivan going, approximately, negative five miles per hour. You are unable to pass him and in your frustration begin to fantasize:
That you press "R" for Rocket Launcher.
That you could hold a class wherein you would teach people proper autobahn driving techniques.
That a ramming device springs out from the front of your car and baps his car FASSSSSSTEEERRR!!!
That every curse you're uttering could be broadcast loudly and in stereo inside his vehicle.
The Psychic Ray of Death spins them off the road where they would be slapped by Mario Andretti who says, "Give me your license!"
Typically, you do not endorse violence. However, you would easily pay $1,000 to see the following fight:
Jackie Chan vs. Jean-Claude Van Damme
Crocodile Dundee vs. Tarzan
Barbie vs. Godzilla
The NRA vs. Congress
Mike Tyson vs. The Incredible Hulk
Bill Gates vs. Robocop
Your mate vs. the defensive line of the Washington Redskins
No, really, I do endorse violence.
During the summer, you generally think:
And that's more than you can say for yourself in the other seasons.
That your children will, any day now, drive you completely insane, and you're close already.
That this fashion trend toward "less is more" is a very good thing.
It's too damn hot.
There is very little you would not do willingly. Except:
Sit in a window seat of a small airplane as you circle in a holding pattern for two hours, even if the captain assures you that the plane has plenty of fuel and the weather is good.
Ever admit that once, just once, you were turned on by a comic book character.
Spend a week walking through the desert, even if you knew that the woman of your dreams would be on the other side.
Software development.
If you were a major league baseball player, you would be best known for your:
Accurate pitching.
Switch hitting.
Enormous bat.
Outlandish requests for a bigger salary. I mean, who can really scrape by on a million a year these days?
You are on a commercial jet liner which crashes in a remote mountain range. Half the passengers survive the impact; fortunately you are one of them. Being the leader that you are, you:
Gather the survivors and announce that you will lead a team down the mountain side to seek help.
Concerned with starvation, declare yourself chef, and send a team to see if the heavy-set woman you spotted earlier in First Class survived.
Gather the survivors around the wreckage and light what remains of the fuel tanks. As the fire grows in intensity, you yell repeatedly, "Why prolong it!"
Hunt down the bar cart. Finding it intact, you organize one last drunken blowout before everyone freezes to death.

Institute for Mercenary Profiling

An average merc ranks in at '55' in all attributes and skills, while '100' is top-of-the-line. The absolute minimum for attributes is '35.' Below that, you sort of fail to do basic things well, like log on to this web site, for instance.
Skills, on the other hand have a "proficient or not" minimum. You either have some talent, a minimum of 35, or you have none at all, 0. You cannot be "slightly" skilled in this biz. ("No, I just take the engines apart. I don't actually know how to put them back together.")

Please adjust your physical attributes as compared to that of an average merc. Scores above 90 are not allowed (c'mon there Hercules, get honest with yourself).
You sure? Less than 35 in a skill means that you have no proficiency.

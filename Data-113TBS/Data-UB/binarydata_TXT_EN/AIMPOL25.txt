STATEMENT OF POLICIES AND REGULATIONS
Any and all "EMPLOYERS" agree to have read and understood the terms and conditions that hereby follow, and accept them as the one and only agreement governing the engagement of a member, or members, of the ASSOCIATION OF INTERNATIONAL MERCENARIES (A.I.M.), hereafter referred to as the "ORGANIZATION".
Furthermore, an "EMPLOYER" waives any and all rights based on any understandings, or mis-understandings, that may, or may not have, constituted a previous agreement, whether implied or otherwise conveyed.
1.0 Definitions
"MERCENARY" shall mean a member of the "ORGANIZATION" in good standing whose services are offered through said "ORGANIZATION" for the purpose of inflicting bodily harm, and/or death, upon any and all who stand in the way or are otherwise in violation of the interests of the "EMPLOYER".
"EMPLOYER" shall mean a party that engages a "MERCENARY" as defined in 1.1. Said party shall become an "EMPLOYER" and shall accept the terms and conditions associated with said designation, as outlined in this "STATEMENT OF POLICIES AND REGULATIONS", upon tendering payment to a "MERCENARY".
"ENGAGEMENT" shall define the contractual relationship shared by an "EMPLOYER" and "MERCENARY". "ENGAGES" shall mean the act by which one embarks on said relationship. "ENGAGED" shall infer the existence of such a relationship.
"TRAVEL TIME" shall mean the time expended by a "MERCENARY" in arriving at the "LOCATION OF EMPLOYMENT" (Section 3.0) following "ENGAGEMENT" by an "EMPLOYER".
2.0 Length of Engagement
Options: At their discretion, an "EMPLOYER" may select any of the following three time periods for which to engage a "MERCENARY".
Daily. One (1) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour period.
Weekly. Seven (7) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods.
Bi-weekly. Fourteen (14) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods.
A.I.M. reserves the right under special circumstances of its own choosing, promotional or otherwise, to suspend sections 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13, and create any pricing or length of employment scheme it sees fit.
Travel Time. Options listed in Section 2.1 are devoid of the time required to arrive at the "LOCATION OF ENGAGEMENT". All expenses related to travel and the time associated therein shall be the sole responsibility of the "MERCENARY".
3.0 Location of Engagement
"EMPLOYER" and "ORGANIZATION" agree that only one country may be designated as the "LOCATION OF ENGAGEMENT". "
Drop Zone Selection. The "EMPLOYER" has the right to select the Drop Zone within the "LOCATION OF ENGAGEMENT" providing it meets the following criteria.
Is accessible through "safe" airspace by helicopter,
Is deemed to be free of enemies,
Pilot visually confirms no enemy presence when entering the zone,
Failure to meet criteria. If all of the criteria in section 3.2 are not met, the pilot will select an alternate drop zone. This zone will be as close as possible to the "EMPLOYER" selected zone, yet meet all the requirements of section 3.2
Changes to drop zone. "EMPLOYER" reserves the right to change the location of the drop zone at any time. However, once the pilot is committed to the designated drop zone, "EMPLOYER" forfeits said right.
4.0 Contract Extensions
Renewal. "EMPLOYER" retains the right to offer an engaged "MERCENARY" the option of extending the period for which they are engaged (as defined in Section 2.1) at any point in time. "MERCENARY" retains the right to assume that no such offer is forthcoming until it is indeed made, and is thereby at liberty to solicit other offers of engagement despite being currently engaged.
Right of Refusal. "MERCENARY" is under no obligation to accept an offer of contract renewal. Such acceptance is left to the discretion of the "MERCENARY" in question (usually based on perception of risk and other factors) and the "ORGANIZATION" assumes absolutely no responsibility for said decision.
Exceptions. If "MERCENARY" is engaged under the terms defined in Section 2.13, then said "MERCENARY" waives all rights granted under Section 4.1 and 4.2.
In the event that clause 2.14 has been evoked, 4.1, 4.2 and/or 4.3 may or may not apply based on any legal advice we may or may not have received at that time.
5.0 Terms of Payment
Cash. Payment is due in U.S. currency upon engagement acceptance by a "MERCENARY". This clause equally applies to engagement renewal as defined under section 4.0.
6.0 Terms of Engagement
Full Extent. "MERCENARY" agrees to respect the period of engagement and shall remain at the "EMPLOYER'S" disposal until its completion. This represents the full extent of the "MERCENARY'S" obligation.
Disclaimer. With regards to Section 6.1, or any other applicable section or sub-section, the "ORGANIZATION" assumes no liability as to "MERCENARY" behavior and/or actions.
This is an all encompassing, general purpose disclaimer with validity in jurisprudence (See: Jack Richards versus Larry Roachburn, A.I.M., et al., New Jersey Court of Appeals, 1996 and Gus Tarballs versus Biff Apscott, A.I.M., et al... Supreme Court of Canada, 1997)
7.0 Engagement Termination
Completion. Engagement can come to a conclusion by any of the following means, all of which are deemed to have been completed to the full satisfaction of the "EMPLOYER", whom revokes the right to recourse for compensation under any circumstances they may, or may not, construct as being premature.
Natural Expiration. "MERCENARY" has completed engagement under the terms of Subsections 2.11, 2.12, OR 2.13
Forced Termination. "EMPLOYER" has prematurely terminated the engagement with "MERCENARY".
Death. Body of "MERCENARY" drops to room temperature.
8.0 Equipment and Inventory
Baggage. A "MERCENARY" may elect to offer an "EMPLOYER" the option of purchasing a pre-selected inventory which said "MERCENARY" would be prepared to transport free of charge to the "LOCATION OF ENGAGEMENT" (as per Section 3).
Ownership. If an "EMPLOYER" exercises the option to purchase inventory offered under the terms of Section 8.1, said inventory becomes the sole property of the "EMPLOYER", who may exercise the rights associated with ownership of his/her own free will.
In the event that clause 2.14 has been evoked causing clauses 4.1, 4.2 and/or 4.3 to possibly be devoked, then clauses 8.1 and 8.2 in all likelihood will probably not apply.
9.0 Medical

If, after the completion of medical treatment, there exists any remaining funds, in trust, the balance shall be forwarded to the "EMPLOYER".

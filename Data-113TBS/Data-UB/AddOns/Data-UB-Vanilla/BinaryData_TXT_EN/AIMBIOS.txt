His studies included the theory behind incendiary devices, and the technical aspects of electronics and circuitry. He also took locksmithing and swimming courses, but failed the latter.

Whether it's jungle warfare or close-quartered combat, Blood Hanson is your man for the assignment.

A bear of a man, Grizzly Bornell carries the big guns of battle with authority. Even though heavy weapons are his specialty, he is just as lethal empty-handed.

Ivan, a former decorated Red Army Major, joined A.I.M. over three years ago.

In order to improve his relationship with commanders, Ivan has enrolled in an "English as a second language" course.

Following in his uncle's footsteps won't be easy for Igor. His uncle Ivan Dolvich is legendary. Though Igor may be new to A.I.M., he is by no means new to armed conflict. He perfected his stealth abilities while seeing intensive action in Chechnya. And did we mention Ivan Dolvich was his uncle? A bloodline simply impossible to ignore.
Igor and Ivan are already being referred to as the Russian "I-Team."
This ex-Ranger and sniper has turned stalking into an art form. Shadow could be lurking right next to you and you'd never know it. That snow drift, sand dune, shrub, or satellite dish could easily be this master of sneak. Kyle Simmons is a soldier who has made it his business to blend into any environment for any length of time.
The Shadow brings his own camouflage supplies and wishes to make it known up-front that he doesn't share.
This mad, mumbling Scotsman is from the old school of explosives where your instructors would fly by in pieces as you quickly moved up the ranks. Spragg is a survivor.

Fidel hasn't quite been himself lately.
Initially trained as an emergency room nurse, Fox Guzzman was recently featured in "Babes and Bullets," a prestigious monthly mercenary magazine. Her article on instructing medical personnel in the proper control of battlefield hemorrhaging was almost as highly praised as her centerfold layout. Rumor has it that Fox is equally skilled with both hands.
Guzzman has recently spent a lot of time on the firing range and it has paid off handsomely.
Whether it's sharing a spot of tea with British blue-bloods or putting a .38 slug into an unwanted nuisance, Sidney does it with poise and dignity.

After rather heated negotiations, A.I.M. is pleased to announce that the legendary DFK annihilator, Gus Tarballs, is now a member of our ranks.

A massive man of very few words, John Peters prefers to let his actions speak for him. Despite his experience as a U.S. Army MP, he has a concerted lack of respect for authority and angers easily.

Bull packs more power in his punch than anyone else currently on our roster.

While all of this has left her bitter, she has been able to channel her anger into her work with firearms.
Garneau was recently certified as an auto and heavy weapons specialist.

Former L.A.P.D. SWAT team sharpshooter, Sgt. Charlene Higgens left the force for A.I.M. to work alongside her husband, Ron.

Some say that South America hasn't been quite as well-behaved since he left.
Stephen has proven to be a fine squad leader, especially during night maneuvers.
The amiable Scully Sullivan is a long-time A.I.M. member. He's one of our most distinguished mercenaries and perhaps the most respected among his peers.

Scully is well-known for his skills with a bladed weapon.
Jean Pierre may be a little rough around the edges, but he is extremely sharp with a blade in hand. He acquired most of his skills while working as the head doorman at a nightclub.

Dr. Q's salary is currently under review.

Despite his career change, he hasn't lost his combative edge or the substantial belly he developed as a renegade biker.
Edgar has a knack for getting into inaccessible places. Just make sure they aren't too small or narrow.
This vegetarian New Age healer has an amazing grasp of medicine for a man who's never seen the inside of a university med school. He also has a decent grasp for killing quickly and quietly. Born on outskirts of Berlin, he now calls California home where he lives in the mountains with his newborn son and ex-wife, Cassandra.

First off, a correction is in order: Sterling's previous bio mistakenly stated that she was a member of the British Special Forces when, in fact, no such service exists. She served with the British Special Air Service (SAS). A.I.M. regrets the error and any inconvenience it may have caused.

For a man who just completed his internship, he can certainly wield a mean scalpel.
Don't mess with Meltdown. She may be smiling in her file photo, but that smile is deceptive.

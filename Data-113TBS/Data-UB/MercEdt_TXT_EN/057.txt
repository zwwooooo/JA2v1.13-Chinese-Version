Threat!
It's show time.
They're on me.



Something's moving.

Something's in the air. I know it.


See something.
Stuff.
Gun's tapped out.
Got... hit... bad! Ain't looking good.



Didn't quite catch that?
Squat! Weapon won't fire.

I'm still here!
One of these days..my luck's gonna run out.
No way. Can't make that shot.
Took one. Need a patch.
Ahh.. About time for beddy-byes.
Need... air!
Annihilated.





Musta been a ten foot spray on that.

Done! What next?
Not gonna happen!


Somebody needs their butt kicked.
This ain't going very well...
We stick with it, we'll get it done.
Bombers!
Gotta get our hands on some better equipment. It's embarrassing to be seen with this stuff.


I noticed improvement.
Probably wanna rethink that.
Figured as much.







Think my corneas got scorched.
Getting discouraged. Wasting my time.
Seemed alright.
We got work to do. There's enemies.
We didn't finish the job. Stay awake.

It's a dog-eat-dog world!


Think we're alone.


Eyeing a savage cat.
To be honest, I wasn't sure about this place when I got here, but my little romp through the Tracona countryside turned out to be a rather pleasurable experience. I'd do it again.
Squat! They bugged out.
Catching shut-eye before I fall over.
Better now. Wide awake.
Put me down, too!
Fine time for this to be on the fritz.
Got too many parts. It's rigged.
Don't look right around here.

Got here. Need a game plan.
Laptop's happening. We're plugged in.
Man. My neck is stiff.
DON'T GLIDE is a bit of an understatement.
Ain't safe staying here too long.
No way out up here. Gotta do something about that door.
There's no turning back now. I'm seeing this through.
Should be wearing a parka. What's the deal with that anyway?
Found the nest. I say, let's do it.
Ain't gonna find a fast-food joint around here.
It's good to be out of the snow, but it looks like it's gonna be awhile before I feel my fingers again.
We're missing bodies. Didn't all get through.
Better lock and load. After a blast like that, I'm sure they're doing the same.
I count everyone as being here. Good.
You gotta know she's the only store in town.
An savory, yet necessary fellow.
Let me get right to the point!
Never thought I'd run into an Eskimo down here.
Don't know much about Arulco, Manuel, but I figure Tracona's gonna have some scar tissue before I leave here.
Keep a lid on it, Colonel... And remember... you're working with us now.
Stay close, John. Don't want to lose you too early.
You aren't gonna get us killed, are you Tex?
Something new to try.
Going through that fan's gotta be one of the most foolish things I ever considered actually doing.
He won't be bothering anybody anymore.
Let me check out that paper.
Never seen nothing quite like that... Doubt I ever will. Kinda heartwarming actually.
Something tells me we're gonna be seeing resistance from here on in.
Used to own one of these. A hand mortar. Got a few bucks for it, too.
Think that was the last of 'em. None to soon, either.
He was right. We won't be threatening him anymore.
Oh, man... He blew everything...
Wire cutters would have been nice. Guess I'll have to force it and let everyone know exactly where we are.
Now that's what I call a door!
Heard something move below us.
What's up with that?
We're being paged. Our fan's awaiting.
They were gonna blow the crap out of Arulco alright. Paper's got the missile coordinates for almost every town. Even got the coordinates for this place...
Hey... I got an idea. I just gotta change a few things on the control panel and hustle it into the elevator when I'm finished. Then, I can step back and enjoy the show.

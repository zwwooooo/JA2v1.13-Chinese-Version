³ Roses are red, ³ ³ Violets are blue. ³ ³ I know I'm sweet, ³ ³ What happened to you? ³
³ Thinking of you ³ ³ makes me want to vomit. ³
³ Love conquers all things; let us, too, surrender to love. ³ ³ -Virgil ³
³ I've got you deep in the heart of me. ³ ³ - Cole Porter, ³
³ Thanks for making last night so special. ³ ³ I'll never forget you. ³
³ Happy Birthday! ³ ³ In the spirit of the occasion, I won't kill you - for now. ³
³ May your death be slow, bloody and painful. ³ ³ And may I be there to watch it. ³
³ Even though many miles separate us, you're in my heart and my dreams. ³
³ A little under the weather? ³ ³ So sad to hear that your illness isn't lethal. ³

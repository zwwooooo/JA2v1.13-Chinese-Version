JA 2 programmers are the best there are... oh.. well maybe not since this message should never come up...
Glock 17
Even though most of this Austrian pistol's parts are plastic, it will get detected by airport x-ray machines. The simple design of this recoil operated self-loader contains only 32 components, and is a common army issue worldwide.
Glock 18
Of Austrian origin, the Glock 18 is deserving of the classification of machine pistol. As the Glock 17's successor, it was built to offer the option for automatic fire. Sorry, but parts from the Glock 17 and 18 are not interchangeable.
Beretta 92F
U.S. Army issued, the Beretta 92F is a standard 9mm Parabellum pistol, with a modified trigger-guard to allow a two-handed grip. This is a very functional weapon.
Beretta 93R
The most pistol you'll ever need. Classified as a machine pistol, it features a fold-down front grip and an extendible steel shoulder stock, that attaches at the rear of the butt, to facilitate three-round mode shooting.
.38 S&W Special
The standard Smith and Wesson military and police double-action revolver is ideal for both self-defense and offensive purposes. When the mainspring ages however, the gun is prone to light hammer blows.
.357 Barracuda
The Belgian .357 magnum Barracuda revolver is a powerful choice for both offense and defense. Numerous test trials have shown that both men and women find it easier to handle than most handguns.
.357 Desert Eagle
This single-action, power-packed, gas-operated pistol is one hundred per cent U.S. made. Originally produced in Israel, it features a rotating bolt for positive lock-up, an ambidextrous safety, a steel frame, and a nickel or chrome finish.
Colt .45
This American made automatic pistol of classic design, is one of the most successful combat pistols ever invented. A proven man-stopper, it creates a wide wound channel that can cause severe nerve trauma.
H&K MP5K
Heckler and Koch's MP5K is one of the most compact and deadly German sub-machine guns around. Anti-terrorist groups and drug cartels love this weapon because it's so small and easy to use. This tiny weapon is easily hidden under clothing.
.45 MAC-10
The U.S. Military Armament Corp. Model-10: a real man's sub-machine gun. Its steadiness allows for single-handed firing and its threaded barrel can fit a 'sound suppressor,' which is similar to a silencer but won't reduce bullet velocity.
Thompson M1A1
Although heavier than most submachine guns, the 'Tommy Gun' is still favored by Commando and Ranger forces. None have been built since the 1960's, but they are still very common, and have definitely weathered the test of time.
Colt Commando
Very small, and yet, very deadly. The Colt Commando is an attractively short and concealable assault rifle that was based on the M16 design. It is extremely popular among several US armed forces, including the DEA.
H&K MP53
This German sub-machine gun has a lethality and stopping power that is definitely disproportionate to its size. When fitted with a special flash suppresser, excessive muzzle flash that is common on short weapons, is eliminated.
AKSU-74
Russian in origin, this sub-machine gun is a shorter version of the AK-74. It's a combat intensive weapon with a bulbous muzzle attachment to compensate for firing 5.45mm Soviet rifle cartridges in a much shorter barrel.
5.7mm FN-P90
Chews through Kevlar like it was butter. The FN-P90 is a blowback machine pistol with truly powerful ballistic capabilities. All controls are fully ambidextrous, with a cocking handle fitted on both sides and two open sights.
Type-85
Of Chinese design, the Type-85 submachine gun is a plain blowback weapon that is remarkably lightweight due to its rotating bolt system. The weapon's manufacturers claim that it also fires the subsonic type-64 cartridge.
SKS
The Simonov self-loading SKS automatic rifle has a simple design and is easy to operate. Developed during WWII, it was later distributed to most Warsaw Pact members. Its only weak spot: it's a little heavy for its cartridge.
Dragunov
This Russian sniping rifle is known for its accuracy. Standard issues with the rifle are the PSO-1 telescope sight and the image-intensifying NSPU-3 night sight.
M24
The Remington M24 is the standard sniping rifle of the US Army. This bolt-action rifle's stock is made of synthetic material with an aluminum bedding lock and comes with an adjustable buttplate.
Steyr AUG
This Austrian automatic rifle has a unique modular design with many interchangeable parts. It was one of the first rifles to use a plastic firing mechanism as well as plastic furniture.
H&K G41
Built to NATO weapons standards, this assault rifle is a great piece of German engineering. It features an ejection port dust cover and a hold-open device to keep the bolt open when emptying the mag.
Ruger Mini-14
Considered to be the great American hunting rifle, it's perfect for paramilitary use. It naturally enhances your ability to hit on target because of its low recoil forces.
C-7
It's the Canadian version of the American M16A2. Trust those crazy Canucks to incorporate such safety devices as a case deflector to prevent empty cases from being flung into the faces of left-handed firers.
FA-MAS
The French Army's FA-MAS rifle was the first 'bullpup' design to enter military service. It handles well, and shoots quite accurately. A bipod can also be attached for steadier shooting.
AK-74
Used as the Soviet infantry's standard automatic rifle, the AK-74 is a smaller caliber version of the AKM. While highly efficient and steady, with minimal recoil, it can be nasty to bystanders, as muzzle gases are diverted sideways.
AKM
As the modernized version of the AK-47 automatic rifle, it was one of the best and most widely distributed Soviet weapons. Designed for mass production, you'll find one of these automatic rifles slung over every frugal mercenary's shoulder.
M-14
Truly American through and through. This lighter automatic rifle offers multiple firing options, but is best kept locked at semi-automatic. Unfortunately, without the ability to change its barrel, it can overheat with sustained firing.
FN-FAL
This Belgian automatic rifle set a new standard in weaponry in the early 1950's. Its robust and reliable design made it simple to use and maintain, despite its tendency for excessive climbing in automatic mode.
H&K G3A3
Made from sheet metal stampings and plastic furniture, this Heckler and Koch automatic rifle sure ain't pretty, but it is definitely robust, reliable and highly effective.
H&K G11
Germany's Heckler and Koch designed this weapon as the fastest automatic rifle around. Its high velocity shots tear right through Kevlar. Despite its unusual appearance, it is very comfortable to use and shoots extremely accurately.
Remington M870
A cherished 12-gauge shotgun for its smooth pump-action, it's a favorite of many police forces around the world. Commonly used as a hunting rifle, it can be found for sale in most local hardware stores.
SPAS-15
The 12-gauge Franchi SPAS-15 shotgun's design is true Italian brilliance. It provides the options for gas, semi-automatic or manual pump action.
CAWS
Olin/Heckler and Koch's Close Assault Weapon System is the ideal light support weapon for any aspiring mercenary. Designed for the 12-guage shotgun shell, it also fires miniature grenades.
FN Minimi
Reputed for its reliability, this Belgian machine gun is gas operated, with a simple rotating bolt system. Its design was adopted by the US Army as the M249 machine gun.
RPK-74
This Russian squad light automatic machine gun is simply a heavy-barreled version of the AK74 rifle. Its only drawback is that it tends to shoot the rifling out of its barrel within 5,000 rounds.
H&K 21
The German Heckler and Koch 21 is a fantastic all-purpose machine gun, featuring a heavy yet easily changeable barrel. Its bipod offers 3 height settings on which the gun can pivot 30 degrees in either direction.
Combat Knife
When the enemy is too close for comfort, this full-tang bowie-styled combat knife will definitely come in handy. It features a serrated 9" blade, and a wooden handle with a heavy-duty guard and pommel.
Throwing Knife
Polish up on your throwing skills with this double-edged chrome-plated high carbon steel blade. This slim little knife is a perfect choice for both novice and experienced throwers.
A Rock
A rock is what you've got in your head if you don't know what one is.
Grenade Launcher
Known for its accuracy at longer ranges, the 40mm M79 Grenade Launcher is not your average rifle grenade. This breech loaded, single shot, break-open weapon is usually fired from the shoulder. It features a blade foresight and a folding-leaf adjustable rear sight.
Mortar
Commonly referred to as the battalion commander's artillery, the M224 mortar is a must-have for the serious mercenary commandant. It is a 60mm caliber lightweight mortar with a finned barrel, sight, M7 base plate and bipod, that was built to specifically accommodate HE shells.
Another Rock
A rock usually associated with a roll is a form of modern music that tends to be loud and a preferred choice of adolescents.

Trip Flare
This illuminating mine with an attached tripwire will shine light on the situation every time. Pull pressure or cutting the tripwire will ignite the flare, visually announcing that enemies are about.
Trip Klaxon
This illuminating mine with an attached tripwire will brighten up the place with a resounding roar. Pull pressure or cutting the tripwire will ignite the flare, which is followed by a wailing siren, letting nearby mercenaries know that enemies are skulking about the area.

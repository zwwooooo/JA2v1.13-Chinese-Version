More trouble.
Time to kick some ass!
I wanna retreat!
Got us another wormy thing.
No way! Look at those big-ass worms... haha!
Twenty-to-one, those big-ass worms been here.
Either I heard something, or I got something in my ear again.
Pee-yew, I smelt it, but one of those worms musta dealt it.
Jeez, sumpthin' about this place got my Henrys in a knot.
I don't like worms. 'Specially not ones that got feet.
The worms are payin' me back for all those fishin' trips!
What's that thing?
Something over there.
My gun's feelin' light.
I'm screwed up bad... really bad.
Razor! Damn, you were so cool! I wanted to be just like you! I was workin' on it, I swear! Aw, this bites the big one.

Bummer, Numb. I was just gettin' to like you. You were psycho! Not as psycho as Razor, Razor's like TOTALLY psycho, but you were almost as good. Bummer.
Ummm...uh...come again?
Out of ammo! No, wait, no I'm not, my gun's jammed.
Jeepin' lizard, I'm about ready to kiss my ass goodbye here!
That was nuthin'. I'm all right.
Whoa! Thought my number was up.
Like I'm gonna hit that from here.
Uh... how much blood can I lose before I have to do something about it?
Sack time for me, for sure.
I gotta slow down. I'm about to cough up a lung here.
Batta-boom, batta-bing!
Fish bait!
Aww, does widdle baby Biffy want his widdle bottle? I swear, what a pussy. Love to kick his ass.



Oh, that is wicked! I wonder if you have time to think, "Ouch."
Ever read about Vlad the Impaler? Awesome dude with the spikes? He's my hero!
I took care of business here.
Sorry, I ain't doing that.
If I'd been married to that bitch, I woulda killed her a long time ago!
Excellent! I'm gonna take some of her eggs home with me and do... some... ah, experiments...
I can't believe that jag-off!
I don't like this whole... thing.
This whole outfit blows chunks.
Bummer. Warplanes.
I can't do anything with this junk.
My last C.O. was a sonuvabitch. Wanna see his left ear? Hehehe, I took it.
I hate today's army. Too many immigrants who don't talk no good English.
I'll be boss in no time!
Looks like a pretty dumb setup if you ask me, and I'd know.
That wasn't supposed to turn out that way, was it.
I've had it with Baby Biffy's whining and crying. You can babysit him if you want, but I'm outta here. Good luck. You're gonna need it.

Yeah, Razor! You're my hero.

See, Numb, I believe in ya. Thanks for not making me look dumb. I hate that.
Hey, asshole. M.E.R.C. tells me you ain't payin' me. And since you get what you pay for, you ain't gettin' me. So long sucker. I'm history.

Shit, that burns! Gonna need one of 'em German Sheppard dogs.
It's like tryin' to get bacon out of your teeth. Impossible.
He's all right. But most of them are losers.
We've got losers around here.
I think I should start turning over rocks until I find every last one of 'em.

How do ya like them apples, roadkill!
Hey! It's Joey boy. Get me a broom handle. I'm gonna whack him upside the head just like my mum used to do.
Bummer. I was up for some good ass kickin', coulda done the job, too. I'm just gettin' warmed up.
Suckers! Nothing left to do but hold the funerals, or whistle for the vultures, hah hah.
Jeez, we got a problem here. Some loser took some of our stuff.
I won't be gettin' any more lip from her.
Whoa! Big-ass cat.
Yeah! Watch the heads roll! We are the coolest. You know, I'm asking for a raise, a BIG raise.
Yeah, the pussies backed out. Ain't no surprise.
Gonna hit the sack. I'm a loser without sleep.
Needed that. I'm up and on the job.
Put me on that list!
Jeez, do you buy everything with a coupon? This thing ain't worth squat!
Some stupid loser put a trap on this.
Ground looks funny. I ain't sending my ass airborne.
You pussies! Just let me drown...why don't ya!
Dragged my ass here. Now what?

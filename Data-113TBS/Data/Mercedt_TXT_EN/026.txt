Boneheads.
They're here, man.
Up to my armpits here, Bub.
Got a crawler! Man, I hate those things.
Big bummer! I've seen one of those before, man. I think it was, ah...'67, or ah, '69. Of course, then it wasn't real.
Those things got a nasty case of the munchies. They give me the willies, man.
Pretty sure I picked up noise, man.
<sniff> Wasn't me, man. I swear!
Gotta keep a clear head around here.
I hate this! Place is probably crawling with them crawlers.
Bummer! I'm livin' my nightmare, man.
Check this out.
Goodies here.
Ammo's spent, man.
Took it really bad, man... I need some medical attention...like now.
That's too bad, man. Larry seemed to be in a really good mood the past couple of days.
Oh that's one big drag, man. Spider was like the girl next door with like a medical degree on her wall to boot, man. Gonna miss her.

What's happenin'?
This ain't cool! My gun's broken, man.
Takin' heat, man!
Gonna be a long night, man.
That sucks.
I don't know. Don't look in the bag to me, man.
I'm staring at blood, man... my BLOOD!
Need to crash, man.
Hunh, woah. I'm wheezing.
I'm smokin'.
That's a relief.
Larry ain't right. He just ain't cool. He ain't the dude I used to know. Makes me sick to my stomach.
Something about Stephen that just reeks, man. He's just a little too...too. I can't put my finger on it, man.
Razor's on the edge...the stress level is like unnecessary, man. So keep some distance between us.
A.I.M.'s got another opening, man.
Had like a firework effect to it. Even made a kind of a chillin' pop sound, man.
I hate bugs, man. Especially bugs that are bigger than me.
I'm up-to-date, man!
I didn't quite get that... well, okay, I did... but I'm ignoring it.
That was like SO anti-climactic, man.
I think we should burn it just to be sure, man.
Conceived in something on wheels for sure, man.
I've had more fun clipping my toe nails.
This team is like losers anonymous.
Look out! They're attacking from above, man.
Bet somebody used this equipment in 'Nam, man.
It'd be kinda cool just to hangout down here.
The Swiss tick me off, man. I think it's 'cause they're just too damn neutral. You know, kinda like cardboard people.
I sort of felt something, man.
Might want to take a look at that on paper, man.
I'm stunned.
Larry's turned into one preachy pain in the ass. If you really feel ya need him, keep us apart, man.
Keep that Swiss desk jockey, Stephen, clear of me. I wouldn't be here if I'd known he was coming, man.
Larry's just so cool, man...you think his head's elsewhere, bingo! He comes through.
Two thumbs up, Spider!

Be patient, man... we'll get around to it.
So... this is where Mike's been working.
Got creature pee in my eyes, man!
This is a waste of time, man.
Seemed kinda cool.
Nice and slow, man... boneheads been detected in this area.
Tired of chasing 'em, man. They'll rear their ugly heads soon enough.

Ya just earned yourself a good cleaning, Mister gun.
Over there! Isn't that the momma's boy?
Hey man, good to be here. Rebels, hunh? Cool. Hey don't you worry, Miguel. We'll smoke her out.
Show's over baby. They're just pushing up weeds now.
You know, I don't think everything's here, dude.
Didn't have no choice, man... She wasn't gonna change.
Cat's on 'roids!
Man, I love this stuff. I can't get no high like it. I mean that, man. I'm gonna miss all of you. Gimme a call sometime, okay?
They caught the big wave outta here, dude.
My lids are heavy, man. Gotta catch a few.
Needed that sleep, man. I'm ready to work now.
Man, me too.
This thing ain't working.
Chill out. This thing is rigged.
Man, I don't like the way that ground looks at all.
Surf's way, way up! To up, man... I'm going under... drowning...
Traveling's over, man. I'm ready for whatever.

You've pulled some bonehead moves in the past, man. I'm gonna hang low for a bit and see what else comes up.
You got quite the collection of bodies, man. Think I'll pass on that offer.
It's out of the question, man. They're dedicating a park to Garcia this weekend. My presence is like required.
I gotta scoot back home. Can't change my plans on such short notice, man.
You're connected with Static, man. Can't yak right now, but let me know where I can find ya, and we'll touch base.
Hope I lived up to your expectations, man. Call me sometime, we'll yak.
I can't work with Larry, man. He's been lecturing me on the twelve steps to straightness, man. It's pathetic and annoying.
That dude Rothman makes me ill. Don't work with consultants, man. I want somebody beside me who can take a bullet, not tell ME how to.
Razor is like certifiable, man. One dangerous dude. I ain't comfy working beside him.
What you thinkin', man? 'Cause I was kinda thinkin' I'd be willing to stick around for a while longer, if you're interested.
Cool. Didn't feel much like packin' anyway.
I'm game, man. Catch ya soon.
I'll take a chance on you. Larry seems to be back to his normal self. It'll be just like the old days, man.
Okay, why not. Spider's on the team, and I like her style.

You're kiddin', right man? Gotta be! I can't get outta here fast enough.
Like I was saying, man...
Ah, we got a problem, man. Your bank put the brakes to the deal. It's too bad, man.
I was just gettin' used to the water, man.

Kirk Stevenson here. Otherwise known as Static. I used to answer that way, but everybody thought I was talking about havin' a poor video connection.
I work best in the dark, man... I make sure everybody knows that, including the ladies.
Take your time, man.
You can really save big bucks on the long-term stuff, man.
I've lost interest, man. Maybe another time.

I'm gonna be up-front about this, man. Me and that Swiss, Stephen, don't see eye-to-eye, if you know what I mean. I'll take the gig, but you gotta remember what I told ya, man.
High-tide on my contract, man. It's almost up.
You gotta figure experience is worth a few bucks more, man, so I upped my price.

Filthy child. What's wrong with you, stupid idiot?
Bubba tired of this. I wanna go home.
Filthy children. I don't know why I waste my time with stupid children.

These guns and things are filthy garbage. I should just throw them away.
Everyone's scared of Bubba. He can't help it. He's just different.
Stupid Arulcans! Just throw them away, filthy idiots!
Bubba learn, slowly.
Bubba thinks that's a great idea.
Was that stupid?


Yes, Bull is GOOD! And Bubba is Bull's best friend!

Bubba proud of Buzz. Bubba knew Buzz was A-OK!

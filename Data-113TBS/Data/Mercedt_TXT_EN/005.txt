More crims!
Crim's up there. I see 'em!
Hell's bells!
A ratbag over there!
Holy-dooly! I never seen one of them before.
Ewwwh. Some bloke was in a barney 'ere.
Hope my ears are playin' tricks on me.
(sniff) Something's been rolling around in, something.
There's something a bit crook here.
Not looking to get into a blue with any of the local bitsers.
I'm lookin' at gettin' pounded here!
Now wussat?
What's that then?
Sod it, me gun's empty.
I'm hit... Christ, I'm hit...


Thor, that's one hell of a bingle you got yourself in, ya dag. Rest in peace, sport.
Sorry, I'm, uh, I'm chuckin' a spaz here.
Oh, no worries, only my flamin' gun's jammed tighter than a fish's arse! Stupid useless load o' codswollip.
This is hard yakker!
Strewth, I'm zonked.
That coulda been a beaut...
No worries, sport, only I can't be sure of dingin' this one!
Uhh, gotta bung a bandage on this before I kark it in a pool of blood and piss.
I wouldn't mind crashin' right about now.
I'm seriously buggered here. Eh, lemme catch me breath.
Gotcha, ya nong!
How's that for a thrashing, ya mongrel?
Fidel doesn't have the brains to give himself a headache. Damned bushranger.


I sunk the unsinkable Mike! How do you like that, then? Heh - I'm rather proud of it, meself!
Strewth, I'm gonna lose me brekkie.

I'm done! Lookin' for something to do.
Don't play the raw prawn with me, sport. I'm not gonna do that.
Hoo-roo! She karked it! She fair dinkum karked it!
Hoo-roo, mama! Beautiful! Next stop, the waterin' 'ole.
That bloody boofhead makes me want to chunder.
This is really crook. I got half a mind to g'wan back to Oz.
Not a fair dinkum grape in the bunch, if you ask me.
Heads up, sports!
These supplies you chucked me aren't worth a brass razoo.

Americans. What a bunch of sooks.
Bonza! Persistence pays off.
Umm...just my say-so, but that'd be a bit of a bollix.
Had a feeling that was gonna go wrong.
Well, you picked up Fidel Dahan, then? He's a first-class greaseball, and if I wasn't a man of me word, I'd duck out right now.



I could tell straight off that Thor was a real cracker!
Right, well, it's like this. I'd like to give it more of a go before I renew, just to make sure.
Strewth, it's Mike! This's a fine how'dyado!
Bloody bug has blinded me!
This is a pain in the arse. What else be there to do?
Quite the sport.
There be a crim about, mate... better be keepin' a close eye.
You can be sure the crim haven't strayed off too far.
Hoo-roo. All right, then...

That's the Joey kid, isn't it?
Good to be 'ere, mate. In Oz, we got us a saying, "Do unto others, before they do unto you." Now, you just tell the lady, an' I say that lightly, to keep that in her in little noggin.
Wey hey! They're all dead! Gotta give 'em an "A" for effort, though.
Easy... a wee bit light on this 'ere, aren't we?
No worries. She's no lady. She 'ad it coming. I'll bet she's got back hair combed up over 'er shoulders.
Mountain cat!
Woo-hoo! We showed 'em who's boss, eh? Purty lot, we are! You know, I reckon I'll be goin' 'ome, but not without thanking you. I 'ad me a regular riot, mate!
Ah, they buggered outta here.
Take me a few winks. I get right silly when I don't 'ave me sleep.
I'm up and right where I was.
Same here.
Bloody hell. I'll just bide me time 'til it fixes itself.
Aw, mate... that there's a right fine trap.
Aw, no... looks like danger, mate!
No worries... 'cept I'm drowning!
Hey, mate, the trek's over.

Sorry, sport. I hear you're a bit of a galah, and I just don't think we'd click.
Sure, if I wanted to kark it. Sorry, mate.
That's a beaut of an offer, but me Mum'll castrate me if I don't make the family reunion this weekend. Next time, right?
That'd be choice, but I was just heading to the tuckshop. Can't live on bush tucker, right? Chuck me a little more of a head's up next time!
G'day, owyerdoin'? Trevor and Sheila aren't available, they're at the beach. Just leave me a winge, and they'll give you a bell back.
It's been a joy, sport! I'm goin' on holiday, spendin' some time with my Sheila. Hoo-roo.
Sorry, cobber, I'd soon bung me Mum on the barbie than sign-up to work with Fidel. You'll find out why if you keep him on.


Wanted to ask if you'll be needing my services for another go. Our contract's up, and I'm game for more.
Fair enough sport, you've been straight with me so far. I'm in.
I believe I can give it a fair go. I'm right behind ya.


I've a few bones to pick about the deal sport, but since Thor's with you, that's recommendation enough for me. I'm in.
Hate to say, I'm not really up for it. This mercenary gig was not as much of a kick as I was hopin' for.
What I said, was...
No worries sport, only I'm a little expensive for you at the moment. Bell me when you're flush, and perhaps we'll give it a go then.
Oh. Well...all right. Sorry I wasn't what you were wantin'. Hoo-roo, then.
Sure, if I wanted to kark it. Sorry, mate.
Sorry cobber, I'd soon bung me Mum on the barbie than sign-up to work with Fidel. You'll find out why if you keep him on.

Trevor Colby here. Owyerdoin'?
If you're looking for a mechanic, I don't think you'll find anyone better'n me, sport. Least I hope not.
BO-RING!
How long d'ya want me? Y'know, a long contract gets you the most bang for your buck.
I'm a busy boy. Bell me when you're feelin' chatty.
I should warn you mate, I'm not too happy about havin' that wanker Fidel on the team. Hope 'e stays outta my way.

Almost 'bout time for me to say, "See ya," mate.
Look at me, mate! Ya know yer gettin' value for the dollar.

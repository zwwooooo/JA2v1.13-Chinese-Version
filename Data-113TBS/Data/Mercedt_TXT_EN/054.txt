More aggressors.
They're here. Let's get the show on the road.
I'd like to get outta here while I can still walk!
Killer chiggers on the loose!
My God! It's like a...it's like the Six Million Dollar Chigger!
I think one of those steriod-induced chiggers came through.
Hear that?
Ugh-ah, I hope someone just cut the cheese. Otherwise, we're downwind of a rampaging giant chigger.
Something's setting off my internal alarms.
Lions and tigers and chiggers...oh, my.
Get outta my face, chiggers! Shoulda packed some DEET!
Looky yonder.
What's lying there?
This gun's empty.
I can't feel anything...I'm as close to dead as you get.



Wait a minute, I lost my bearings. What am I supposed to be doing?
My goddamned gun is jammed, pardon my French.
If I don't get outta here, my goose is cooked!
Thank you. Thank you, very much.
Well... Better to watch it than feel it.
Poor chance from here. Maybe from another position.
If I keep losing blood, sooner or later, I'll black out.
I'm pooped. I have to sack out for a while.
I'm out of breath. Give me a sec.
You're dead, pea brain.
Rubbed out that chigger!




There goes my appetite for the next week.

Ready for something new.
No. I draw the line.
I would rather have seen her suffer for a long time...but hey, this'll do.
Yeah, baby! You make a pretty corpse!
I know what that idiot's problem is: not enough secondhand smoke!
Next time, I'll pick a more exciting assignment...like shooting subway rats in Brooklyn.
Jesus, I hope there's no group photos. I wouldn't want to be seen with this bunch of second grade dropouts.
Holy moly! They're making a strafing run!
There isn't enough scotch tape in the world to hold this cruddy equipment together.


I'm self-taught!
Pretty cheesy plan.
And the Golden Turkey award goes to...






It's a good feeling to have my feet on terra firma. Now, to find that rebel leader Miguel.
Holy moly! I'm unable to open my eyes.
Nothing is going to come of this.
A neighborly kind of fellow.
Tread carefully. There's aggressors around.
We didn't get them all, so let's be careful.
Wow! You don't find one of these every day.

Kid over there looks like he might be hiding from someone.
Maybe on a real good day, Miguel, but we just ruined the chances of that. You let us get to work, and things will be fine.
Yeah! That's a clean sweep! There's no dirt left.
Hold on. Looks like we have a problem here. Where's the stuff?
How's that feel, honey? Just so you know, it feels damn good to me, and everybody else around here.
Dog food!
Nothing like standing by each other through thick and thin, eh? Thanks for everything, and you know what I mean. I was here from day one.
Uh, they pulled out. I hate that.
Gonna grab some sleep. I'll give you a holler when I'm up.
Okay, I'm back to work.
Yeah, I'll echo that.
Need to get this fixed.
Oh baby! We got a live one here.
I wouldn't be going anywhere near that.
One... more minute... That's as long as I can tread...
I'm here. Need instruction.

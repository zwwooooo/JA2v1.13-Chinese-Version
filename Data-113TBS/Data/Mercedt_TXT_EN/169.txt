Threat!
It's show time.
They're on me.
Threat!
It's show time.
Problem!
Something's moving.
Problem!
Something's in the air. I know it.
Ain't safe staying here too long.
They're on me.
See something.
Stuff.
Gun's tapped out.
Got... hit... bad! Ain't looking good.



Didn't quite catch that?
Squat! Weapon won't fire.

I'm still here!
One of these days..my luck's gonna run out.
No way. Can't make that shot.
Took one. Need a patch.
Ahh.. About time for beddy-byes.
Need... air!
Annihilated.
Annihilated.



He won't be bothering anybody anymore.
Musta been a ten foot spray on that.

Done! What next?
Not gonna happen!
Annihilated.
Think that was the last of 'em. None to soon, either.
Somebody needs their butt kicked.
This ain't going very well...
We stick with it, we'll get it done.
Bombers!
Gotta get our hands on some better equipment. It's embarrassing to be seen with this stuff.


I noticed improvement.
Probably wanna rethink that.
Figured as much.






We're being paged. Our fan's awaiting.
Think my corneas got scorched.
Getting discouraged. Wasting my time.
Seemed alright.
We got work to do. There's enemies.
We didn't finish the job. Stay awake.

It's a dog-eat-dog world!

Something tells me we're gonna be seeing resistance from here on in.
Think we're alone.

Annihilated.
Eyeing a savage cat.
To be honest, I wasn't sure about this place when I got here, but my little romp through the Tracona countryside turned out to be a rather pleasurable experience. I'd do it again.
Squat! They bugged out.
Catching shut-eye before I fall over.
Better now. Wide awake.
Put me down, too!
Fine time for this to be on the fritz.
Got too many parts. It's rigged.
Don't look right around here.

Got here. Need a game plan.

Fightin' time.
All right, we're on.
Mayday! Mayday!
Another one of my relatives.
Jesus. Who the hell invited my mother-in-law?
Wonder if anybody can go one-on-one with those things and live.
I hear something.
Peeyew... I can't blame that on the dog... gotta be one of those huge pissants.
I've got that feelin' I always get just before all hell breaks loose.
Come out, come out, you big pissants, wherever you are.
They've got me by the short curlies!
What's that?
Over here.
Gun needs loadin'.
I don't think I'll make it in this condition.
You was my kind of people, Bull. I'll, uh, I'll make sure Jana and the kids are taken care of, and...I was glad to know ya, Bull.
You were amazing, Shadow. How'd they even see you? Learned a lot from you, man. Shoulda told you.
Wolf, you were better than ever, a lean, mean fightin' machine. I hate to see a man cut down in his prime.
Whoa. Just had a little aneurysm. Okay, what was happening?
Misfire. This gun needs unjammin'.
Runnin' into trouble here.
Ya won't hear me complain about a few bruises 'n' cuts 'n' broken bones.
That was close. I don't plan on missing.
Can't get a solid handle on that from here.
Hit a blood vessel. I think I'll be okay.
I'm gonna drop if I don't get some sleep.
Crampin' up. Gotta breathe for a minute.
Another one bites the dust.
I love how they splatter.
Can't believe anybody would ever hire a shifty creep like Dr. Q., let alone make me work with him.


Mike might've been a good merc, but he was just flesh and blood, like everyone else.
Man, that's GOTTA hurt. Then again, maybe not!

All right, done.
Nope, not interested.
Ding, dong, the bitch is DEAD!
Yee-haw! Give birth to that you friggin' egg sac!
That A-hole's startin' to get under my skin.
This assignment's startin' to feel like it's never gonna end.
What a sorry bunch of lily-livered bootlickers.
Aerial attack! Eyes up!
The equipment I've been gettin' musta come right off the boat from Taiwan.

I don't like those oriental types. You never know what they're thinkin'.
Mom woulda been proud.
My granny could come up with a better scheme than that.
Stupid is as stupid does.
You shoulda asked me before bringin' in that crazy Dr. Q. Now I'm pissed. I would of never have signed a contract.

How 'bout that Bull, eh? I love this guy!
Way to be, Shadow. He knows what he's doin'.
I knew there was somethin' I liked about Wolf.
Catch me later. I'm still tryin' to decide if this is my kinda outfit.
Damn - Mike! I didn't count on havin' to go up against him.
Ahh monk breath! I'm blinded!
It can't be done. Well, at least I can't do it.
There's someone with their head screwed on right.
We got a confirmed enemy presence.
We haven't dealt with all of them, yet. Nobody get careless.

Ha! It's all in how ya pull the trigger.
I'm sure that's the twerp mommy's looking for. Joey something or other.
Good to be part of your little tropical situation, Miguel. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
Well, well! That's the last of them.
Hm. Any chance this box came through Harlem's Lightfingers Shipping Company? It's not all here!
Sometimes, there just isn't any other way. Sad to say, but it's the truth. Didn't see an alternative.
Come to Grizzly...
Yeah! That's what I call combat! Mission-to-mission, side-by-side, there's no better group I've ever served with. Let me tell ya, I got enough memories to fill a lifetime. Everyone, keep in touch.
Hmm... Enemy's packed their bags and moved outta here.
I'll just take a couple of winks here. I'm no good to anyone.
I'm up. And I'm getting back on it.
Roger, me too.
Got another Taiwan special here.
Hold on. I got a feeling this is packin' a punch.
Hey, this area looks suspicious to me.
So... much water... so... little air... Can't catch my...breath.
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

Nah! From what I've heard, you and me wouldn't see eye-to-eye.
With your record, you'd be better off lookin' for kamikazes.
Sorry, I'm detailin' my '62 'stang this weekend and takin' her out for a drive up the coast. Been lookin' forward to this for weeks.
Well, y'see, this is the way it works - you want me, you gotta give me some advance warning.
Yeah, this is Steve Bornell. I can't stand these machines, so don't be surprised if I don't get your message for a while. Better to call me back when I'm here.
Maybe we'll do it again some time.
I don't work with Dr. Q., and take my advice, you shouldn't either. Word to the wise, beware of him.


Yeah, about this contract. It's about up. Are we renewing, or what's the deal?
It's always better the next time around, right? Right!
Excellent!
Hey, for a chance to be together with Bull, sign me up.
Hey, me and my Shadow. We're two of a kind, man. I'm in.
You got problems, but a chance to see the Wolf howl again...that appeals.
Yeah, like I'm gonna sign up for more of that. Guess again.
Open up your ears! I already told ya...
Well, ya gotta pay before I'll play. Know what I mean?
Whoa, that was quick. You think you know what you're doin'? More power to ya.
With your record, you'd be better off lookin' for kamikazes.
I don't work with Dr. Q., an' take my advice, you shouldn't either. Word to the wise, beware of him.

Yeah, whaddaya want?
You bring the brain, I'll bring the brawn, y'know...
Talk to me! Like soon!
How long we talkin' about here?
Call me back when you're ready to deal, turkey.


Contract's almost up. Thought you should know.
Don't wanna shock ya, but prices are only guaranteed for the length of the contract.

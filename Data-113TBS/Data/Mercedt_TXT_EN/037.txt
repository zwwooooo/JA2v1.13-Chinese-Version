Unfriendly.
I knew they'd show up sooner or later.
I could use some help.
Insect!
Look at the size of those things! I sure hope the next step up the food chain doesn't hang out here too.
I'd love to take a magnifying glass to those blasted insects. Just like I used to do to ants when I was a kid.
What did I hear?
Ugghh, that smell... it's far worse than any latrine I've ever been in. Even after I was finished.
Let's keep our wits about us. I'm tensing up.
Something tells me those killer insects are gonna show.
If they kill me, at least I'll know the bastards are getting forty pounds less meat.
What's this?
Got something here.
Bullets would be helpful.
I got no sensation in my legs. Ugh, don't think I can move.
That hurts. Fox and I were an item. She's the reason I lost all that weight.
I'm gonna miss not having Lynx around. He saved my butt on more than one occasion.

Come again.
Weapon misfired.
Takin' heat.
That smarts.
Wasn't all THAT close.
The odds suck.
Got a bleeder!
Uhhh, I'm beat. I could use some sleep.
Thought I was... in better shape.
I'm crying.
Problem... eliminated.
Pops McGillicutty is way too old for this business.

You look at a guy like Numb, and ya know his dad didn't kick his ass often enough.
All right! I got to remember to get A.I.M. to put that in my bio.
Lovely! Just freakin' lovely.

That's wrapped up.
Ask someone else.
Killing the head villain is always satisfying. Even more so when it's a broad.
Now... maybe this country can sleep.
What a numbnuts.
I can think of a thousand places I'd rather be than here.
Ya meet all kinds down here.
Bombers overhead!
Second-rate crap. That's what I get for equipment.
Ya know, most of us aren't gonna leave here alive.

That's encouraging.
What are ya on? Dope?
Like anyone thought there was a chance of that working.
Well. What do you know? Old Pops is still alive.

Good one, Foxtrot!
That's Lynx for ya.

Hold on to your socks. I need a bit more time to mull it over.
Holy slimeball! It's Mike.
Damn! All I see are bright flashes.
I'm gettin' nowhere.
Good attitude. I like that.
Be prepared. We've got unfriendlies in this sector.
Stay alert. They'll probably pop out the moment we drop our guard.

Firepower. The difference between life and death.
I'm sure that's Joey Graham, the runaway. Time to put an end to his fun.
Doubt she'll get far, Miguel, we're ready. I'm going to take that crown right off of her head personally.
That's all of them. Nothing left but funerals here.
Hmm. Seems someone's helped themselves. Gonna chop off their hands when I catch 'em.
Now you're just like your sex life: cold, dead and lying in the bed you made.
Savage cat!
If nothing else, this proved one thing - all of my training paid off. And, you know, something else, too. Leadership, good leadership. Don't get a fat head over it, but nice work.
Ah, they pulled out. Sector's secure.
Ya know, no sleep, no focus. I'll just take five here.
Yeah. Things are a little clearer. Back to work.
Echo that.
Hey, this Happy Meal crap broke. It ain't gonna get the job done.
Whoa! Got boom written all over this.
Hold up! That doesn't look too convincing to me. Dangerous, but not convincing.
Noooo! <glub> Tell... Fox... I...cared.
Made it in one piece. What's the story now...

I don't think so. We do talk to each other, ya know. And no one had much good to say about you.
I can't agree to it. Our side's piling up the corpses, and in my opinion, it's mostly due to your recklessness.
Won't be able to make it. Got a PoundShedders meeting tonight. It's the monthly weigh-in, and I'm due for a pin.
Can't stick around. Had I known sooner, I could have cancelled my mother's visit, but she's already at my place waitin' for me.
This is Wolf. You'll have to talk to my machine.
Enjoyed working for ya. Now that you know I can do pretty much anything, you give me a shout if ya need me again.
I told you when I left. Pops is way too old for me to count on. And you still haven't gotten rid him.

I can't see myself signing on as long as Numb is on the payroll.
I need to know what your contract intentions are. I've got people waiting.
Consider it done.
Can't wait to get there.
No matter who she's working for, Fox is worth working with. I'm in.
I've got a few problems with your operation. But, you are smart enough to have Lynx as a member of your team... Okay, I'm in.

Working for you is far too painful to repeat.
It's like this...
Cancel everything. I heard from your bank. I think we both know what I'm talking about.
Too bad. I thought I was gonna park it down here for a while. Oh well...
I can't agree to it. Our side's piling up the corpses, and in my opinion, it's mostly due to your recklessness.
Pops McGillicutty is way too old for this business. Either you force him to retire - or I'm getting outta here.

Wolf here.
Nobody does anything like I do.
I'm gonna have to eat at some point.
What kinda time frame did ya have in mind?
I got a life to get back to. Maybe you should find yourself one, too.
Killing gramps oughta save the A.I.M. pension fund a little bit of cash.

I'm looking at packing my bags shortly.
New contracts, new rates. Figure I'm worth few extra dollars now.

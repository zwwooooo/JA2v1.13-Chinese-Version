Have a sighting.
I've got... I have located the presence of a grunt, sir.
This is all too real, man.
Flashback!
Looks like it's from an evil swamp or something, sir.
Those swamp insects are real serious.
Who made that noise?
That's disgusting. Smells like swamp gas.
Buckle up! I gotta... I have concerns about the road ahead.
My swamp creature sensors are primed, sir.
Kinda wish this was all mushroom induced, man.
There's something.
Found something.
Gonna need a resupply of ammo.
Oh, this is considerably more painful straight.
Poor Biff. He was so young, so misunderstood. He was the only guy who would give me a ninth chance at proving myself. I'm gonna miss his little redhead.

Ah, man... Somehow, I knew Flo wouldn't survive this cutthroat life. But she put a smile on Biffy's face, so I said nothing.
I seemed to have had a brain relapse, sir. They told me that would happen.  What's up?
Bullet's stuck!
How's a guy supposed to stay sober?
I deserved that.
Could be a good night for poker...
Even with sober vision, that shot's difficult, sir.
Need to be bandaged! And I need a... just a little... ah, taste of Demerol.
Put in a good shift, man... uh, sir. Need some winks.
Two packs a day too many, sir. Need a breather.
You were, now you ain't.
You're tuna bait!
Static's a loser. He was a bad influence on me, sir. Can't stand being around him anymore.
That Ruthless Reuban is one real frightening dude! I don't think I want to go into battle with him, man.
I don't want to be a squealer, but that Steroid is on drugs, sir. It ain't good for me to be around people on dope. At least that's what my counselor says.
I can't watch Steroid do drugs anymore, man. It's just too hard. I gotta leave.
And people ask me why I did drugs?

I'm all done.
Not as long as I got... have a clear head on my shoulders, sir.
I told everyone I'd do her.
Nothing will ever haunt me again.
I'd like to put that loser through a twelve-step program. First step has my heel smack in his forehead.
Being straight is a real drag... Everything is, like, so predictable.
I miss the old group. Guys like Reuban, Smoke, Skitz, Vinny and Tex. Man, I miss Tex.
Incoming!
I bet they were giving me the shit stuff for years. I just didn't realize it.
I'd really like to get to know some of these guys better.

Credit a clear head, sir.
Don't think we're thinking this out.
Figured as much, man...uh, sir.
Static's wearing me down. I gotta... I have to get out of here before I give in to his influence.
Sorry man, but Unusually Ruthless Reuban is like a little too scary for me! Either you cut him loose, or I'm headed back to the lab, man!
Biff's gonna be a fine merc someday.

You gotta watch out for the shy, quiet types. They always surprise ya.
Gotta go! Speck wants to see me. Something about a bill that hasn't been paid.

This ain't cool! I can't open my eyes!
I think I should just forget it, sir.
She turned out to be all right, sir.
There are grunts...uh, enemies present around here, sir.
The area isn't clean yet, sir. I'd advise caution.
I know I'm excited, sir.

It's that little shi...uh...missing child, sir.
Let go, let God, sir. I'm clean, serene and mean, and if you need me again, just call. I needed a meeting anyway.
The area's all clean, man... sir.
Man, looks like some stuff's missing. Ya got insurance, huh, sir?
Sometimes 'Live and Let Live' just doesn't cut it, sir.
Easy does it, man!
I just want to say that I'm grateful, sir, to everyone and to my Higher Power. It was tough, but we all did it one day at a time. Man... do I want to get shit-faced! Uh, just kiddin'...
The grunts have moved on, sir.
Sack time helps me to perform better, sir, and I need some. I'll be up making coffee before you know it.
I just knocked back some coffee and I'm ready to go, sir... Think I might be addicted to that stuff.
Me too, sir.
Time to put this thing in the shop, sir.
Whoa... It looks like a booby trap, sir.
Man, uh, sir, I believe this area could be dangerous.
I'm... going... under... water... sir... Need... ass...istance... like... now... man...
Like, I'm all here now, man, uh sir.

More scum!
Okay, let's pop some zits.
Got my butt in a sling here!
Boogiebug in the vicinity.
God, I used to think somethin' like that lived underneath my bed. We called it, "the boogieman."
Lookit this mess. Must've been left by one of them boogiebugs.
I heard a funny noise.
Christ-mas, that's foul.
Gettin' goosebumps. Usually happens before all hell breaks loose.
Gotta keep an eye out for those boogiebugs.
The boogies are nailin' me!
Check that.
Someone dropped something.
This baby needs ammunition.
I ain't dead yet, but that's about the only good news I got.



Gimme that again. I got turned around a bit.
This gun picked a fine time to jam up.
Good time for a grenade.
Aah, playground stuff.
Good thing I ain't afraid to die.
That shot don't look good from here.
I got a rare blood type, so I better stop bleedin' soon.
I'm ready to drop. I should catch a few winks.
Need a minute...to get my breath back.
Ashes to ashes!
Back to hell.




Euh, takes a helluva lot to make me puke, but that's just about my limit.

Squared away. Find me somethin' else.
I don't feel much like it.
Wasn't nothin'. Though, I'd love to do it again.
Yee-haw! That sure beat steppin' on it.
What a wampass.
I'd rather be sellin' cookies door-to-door than puttin' up with this crap.
I dunno what rock these guys crawled out from under, but most of 'em creep me out.
The bastards're flyin' in low!
This equipment and a buck wouldn't get ya a cup of coffee.


I'm gettin' the knack.
And where's the brains of this outfit?
What the hell did we THINK was gonna happen? A miracle?






The place looks deserted. Finding Miguel is gonna be like looking for a needle in a hay stack.
I got sprayed in the eyes. Everything's a blur.
I could spend my life trying to get this.
What a character.
We know there's enemies present. Let's see if we can flush them out.
They're still around...somewhere. Let's not get cocky.

I just love this weapon.
He looks like momma's boy. Let's grab him.
Can't wait to see her try it, Miguel. She'll be wishing she went to beauty school when I get through with her.
Yeah, baby. That's the last of this group of losers.
How's about someone cough up the missing stuff before I start snapping heads?
Bitch. Lie still. Mind you, if she gets up, I want to shoot her again. Best thing I've done all day.
Holy litterbox!
Right on! You know, I always knew we could do it. You and me? Well, we started out that day in Omerta, and we haven't looked back since. Thanks for the experience.
Aw, looks like the poor widdle babies got scared and ran away. Just us here now.
I'm gonna crash for a sec. Let you know when I get back on the job.
I'm up and on it.
Hey, I said it first.
This is broken, doubt it's even worth holding.
Whoa! This baby's ready to do some damage.
I wouldn't walk near there even if it was the only way to the outhouse.
Drowning! Holy shit! Gotta get... <glub> outta here!
So tell me, what's the plan now that I'm here?

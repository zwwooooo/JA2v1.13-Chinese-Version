Uncovered an enemy!
Located the enemy, commenced combat.
I'll give you a head start before I shoot you.
I've got a problem here.
Warning!
Naaah... an organ bank?
I hear something over here.
*sniff* They're out there...somewhere.
I sense some sort of bad streak is developing down here.
Go slowly around here. They're out there...
I've got a couple in proximity!
Came across something over here.
Look!
Get me some ammo!
Fadin' in and out... Need medical attention, now...
Losing Scully... It's like losing a brother.
*losing second friend*
*losing third friend*
There's no excuse for that...
My firearm is jammed!
Big mistake, gunner-boy!
Under fire! Want to engage!
They'll have to do better than that!
I'm unable to sight the target.
Need to be patched...
*yawn* Time to call it a day!
I have to catch my breath.
Welcome to the club!
Target eliminated.
*against hated merc*
*against hated merc*
*against hated merc*
It was pathetic...  Real pathetic!
...It's a bit irregular.
*personality trait remark*
Everything checks out! I'm yours!
I'll have to decline.
And just so there's no confusion, you're... terminated!
Got something to say before you die?
You're trash! And everyone knows it!
I get the impression you're grabbing at straws. Not really sure of what you're looking for in the lines of a team!
Whatever team I may be on has to bag missions on a consistent basis! It's an image thing, you understand?
Warning!
It's trash! What a slipshod operation you're running!
What a bunch of losers! I can't operate with mercenaries I don't trust.
*hated nationality*
It just goes to show ya what spending that little extra can do for ya.
Have you lost your mind?
I could sense the outcome developing here.
*hated merc is hired*
*hated merc is hired*
Scully takes to the point like no one else.
*buddy merc 2 is victorious*
*buddy merc 3 is victorious*
I'm not interested... Maybe if you win the next mission, we can work something out.
Me? Mike? The best in the business...? You're tempting fate.
I'm unable to sight the target.
No can do!
He takes to the point like no one else.
They're out there...somewhere.
Consider this a warning! Mike's on your case. And I ain't sleeping till you're dead!
Surprise, surprise... 
Just like old times. I'm too good.
Big mistake, boy!
You waited a long time to bring your operation up to snuff so you could hire me and now you're stiffing me? Me? Mike? The best in the business!
Platoon eliminated!
It seems someone has been doing some digging.
You're... eliminated!
Target in sight.
Another successful mission! Just like old times.
Consider this a warning! Mike's on your case. And I ain't sleeping till you're dead!
*yawn* Time to call it a day!
Another day, another dollar... Or a couple of thousand for that matter!
I'm sure I mentioned that...
Even I can't get this damn thing to work.
Whoever rigged it didn't do much of a job. I should be able to disable it.
Go slowly here... It seems someone has been doing some digging.
I can't keep my head above water any longer!
I'm over here!

Grunt, man.
Some grunt just ruined my stroll, man.
Oh, man. I could use another hit...
Another bug, man!
Holy, cockroach, Batman! Hate to see the fridge they crawled out from!
Supreme grossness, man.
Did somebody say something?
<sniff> <sniff> Ohhh, man... I gotta eat better.
Things are really quiet, man.
Stay on roach alert, man. And I ain't talking about sifting through ashtrays.
Man... I miss the days when you could just stomp on 'em.
Check it out, man.
Think I see something... ahhhhh... probably not.
Need lead for my toy, man.
You think I could have one last good shot of something? Don't sound like too much to ask.
Ah not Static, man. Well... RIP, man. Not sure what it means, but I see it on graves all the time.

Steroid, oh man... you're not to be seen no more. You were one pumped up Polish prince, man. I'll give you a little something to take with you.
I can't remember...remember anything, man.
Must be made by foreigners. It won't fire, man.
Cool!
Ahhhhh... Feels like the time I got hit by a bus, man.
What was that, man?
Yeah... right, man.
Medical kit!
I spot a sofa, I'm crashing, man.
Whoah! I'm gettin' all light-headed, man.
Played out, man.
Smokin'!
Biff, you're a loser! Your head belongs in somebody's garden, man.

Get real, man. The chick's an accountant! Flo's got no business being here. Just 'cause the boss popped a zit over her, don't mean I gotta die!
I quit, man! Another day in Arulco with Florence of France, and I'd shoot her myself, man... I mean... you gotta know it's gonna happen.
Cool!
The country we're in is named... uh, what again?
It's my shift to sleep, isn't it man?
Don't think so, man.
There's a little bit of her in all of them, man.
My counselors are always going on about this inner-child crap, man. I think I just took care of it!
Take something, man... It'll do us all some good.
This place sucks, man! I liked it better in rehab... and they gave us crayons.
Uptight! Never seen so many tight-collared, party killers in my life. It's like freakin' tax time around here, man.
What kind of bird is that, man?
What third world country was this crap made in, man?
I just want to be left alone. Ya know, to do my own thing, man.

Feel like I'm losin' my edge.
Man... that's exactly what I was thinking.
Maybe we should take another whack at it, man?
I gotta get outta here, man. Biff craps his pants so often, he should be wearing a diaper. Maybe AIM will take me back. Just need some Visine and a shower, man.

Static's the best, man. He's got style.

Steroid puts out a fire like nobody else, man.
I'm outta here, man. I'll let your accountant tell ya why.

Whoah! Real cool! Always wanted to try being blind, man.
This is some kinda bad joke, man.
Yeah, right...
Watch your back! We're in gruntland, man.
Probably hiding somewhere praying we'll go away, man.
This is too cool, man!

That kid looks like the runaway. Bet he's on drugs... I'll check his pockets.
Whatever, man. I wanted to take some time off to see what grows down here anyway.
They're all dead, man. Or really, really sick...
Ah, man, I think the Customs guys got into this box.
I knew people like her in rehab, except they couldn't be fixed quite as quickly, man.
What a trip, man!
Said I couldn't do it, man! But I did. Heh, I feel good. Sorta like I could do anything... maybe even get sober.  Nah, who am I foolin'? Take it a day at a time, man.
The grunts put it in reverse, man. Didn't leave no forwarding address.
I'm crashing, man.
Hello, my name is Larry... Uh. Where am I? Oh, yeah. I'm up and back to work, sir.
Ditto, man.
Man, this thing's had the bird.
Man... careful, Larry. It's got too many parts.
Call me a skeptic, man, but watch where ya put your feet.
I ain't floating, man! Help me!
That's another trip over, man!

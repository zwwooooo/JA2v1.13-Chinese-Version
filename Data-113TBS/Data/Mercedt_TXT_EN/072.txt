Hello baby!
Can I pull their legs off with my bare hands, please?
Yeah! Gimme more! More! More!
C'mere bug!
Nothing! I have fried bigger bugs in the junkyard. Let's cook it.
Dis reminds me of my room at home. My dad was always on me.
Oh oh, someone say something?
Now that's my kinda smell!
Ooh, the hair on my back rises in excitement.
Little buggies come out come out wherever you are...
You're all gonna die trying, bugs!
Something!
Lookie!
I hate dis. More bullets.
I've never seen my intestines! What... is that? Kinda long...


Oh, no. Dis is bad. Dis is bad. Very bad. Foxy, Foxy, Foxy. Oh, Foxy. Uhh, what's the chance of puttin' her in ice?
Whoa. I hit myself in the head. What was I doing again?
It's jammed. Maybe I can suck the bullet out.
Ah ha ha ha! Morons!
Dat was almost as good as sex.
I love the excitement.
Personally, I'll shoot at anything. Just don't expect me to hit it.
Hey! Blood! Now I can fingerpaint!
Hey. I didn't get my afternoon nap. I'm starting to feel it.
Whoa. Next time I kill someone, I take their lungs.
Did it hurt, moron?
Rather kill a human.




Whoa, got brain in my mouth! Uh, say... sweet.
Every once in a while, I need to pull my own hair out. I don't know why, but it grows back.
That was boring. Next?
Stick it in your ass!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Bleed, you stupid bitch! You ruined everything! I hate you! I hate you! I say we all urinate on the body.
Ah ha ha! Scrambled eggs for everyone!
Shut up, or I'll peel your eyelids back.
I'm bored out my bug-balled tree...
Sure, they look at me like I am something of a crazy man, but THEY are the crazy ones! One day, I will kill them all.
Bombers!
I'd be better off using an old bumper from the junkyard then dis crap! Is junk! And I know junk!
You know, it's fun to kill everything.

It doesn't matter.
Sounds like a plan.
What happened?




Foxy, you are one sexy lady. Look at you go.
Where's my money?
Dis is it! No money? No Maddog. I kill her myself, for myself, for free.
Hey! All is black now!
Why am I bothering with this?
I don't get it. Why is he friendly? What's his problem?
We're going to see action. As soon as they show their heads, I'll let 'em have it!
Let's just fire wildly 'til they come out of their hiding spot.

How can people question my love for this?
There's the runaway. I bet he think this is funny. I will pull his cheeks out a foot from his face. See if he laughs then.
I don't care. This team crap wasn't for me anyway.
Hahahaha! They all fell like pantyhose from a five dollar woman.
Hey! I think someone's been in the box. I'm gonna put 'em back in it, too, just as soon as I find out who it is.
If I had the time, I would've had some fun with her first, but...
Carpet!
It was fun! Where do I sign up to make career of this? Hard to believe they pay money too.
The babies ran away!
Okay, I get sleep. Gotta get rid of the shakes.
I'm feeling like daisy.
Me first.
If it wasn't already broken, I'd break this damn thing.
Oooh! Let somebody else do it. Someone I don't like.
Oooh! Looks like someone left something for us!
Hey. Look at... <glub> the pretty fish... <glub> hey...
I'm here. I ate every bug on the way. There were many.

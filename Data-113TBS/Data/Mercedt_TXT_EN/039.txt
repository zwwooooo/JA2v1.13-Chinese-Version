Another lamb.
Okay, let's paint the town red... with the enemy's blood!
I got a foot in the grave here!
Mudpuppy from hell!
Izzat what all the fuss is about? An overgrown mudpuppy? I'll split 'em from head to toe and feed their guts to my rotweilers.
Looks like the mudpuppies had a picnic.
Who the hell made that noise?
<sniff> Smells like we're crawlin' up a mudpuppy's ass.
I gotta feelin' we're about to step into somethin' high, wide and deep. I've never felt better!
Mudpuppy alert. Not sure why, I just know they're comin'.
You motherlovin' mudpuppies. I'll see you in hell!
Got something here.
What the hell is that?
Goddamn gun is outta goddamn ammo.
Damn... I'm worm food.


Oh, Stephen, tough tarts, man. You weren't bad, as far as men go. Adios, amigo.
What the hell's wrong with me? I forgot what I was doin'.
Goddamn it, now my motherlovin' gun is jammed!
If these assholes take me down, I'm takin' them all with me!
I got worse than that from my old man when I was three. Gave it back to him good, too.
Now I'm pissed.
Do I look like a magician? Forget it.
Hey, I burst a blood vessel over here.
I've gotta sleep. No shit.
I'm outta breath.
Eighty-sixed.
Play dead, mudpuppy!
How does that chickenshit Biff rate this team, anyway?

Flo ain't fit to wipe my ass.
When Mike saw who he was facin', he knew the end was coming. I could see it in his eyes.
Wouldja look at that? Hey, when do we eat?

All done.
Bite me. Get someone else to do it.
Yeah, baby! She went down smooth 'n easy... speaking of which, I could use a shot of whiskey.
That's it? C'mon, you pussy, get up and fight! I was just warming up! HAHAHAHA!
What a pablum-puking buttwipe.
I've just about had it with this candyass operation.
I'm livin' with dorks, dinks, and twerps. What're ya gonna do?
They're bringin' in their goddamn bombers!
Crappy guns, crappy ammo, crappy armor... I got nothing to work with here.
I love my work! Killing can be a lot of fun, when you have the right attitude.
Too many men in this line of work. They're great for the grunt stuff, but they just don't have the stomach for the rough stuff.
Effin' A'!
That ain't gonna work! How dumb do I look?
What the hell else was expected?
With that suckass Biff around, we might as well pack it up and go home. If I'd known you were gonna let him in, I wouldn't have signed that contract.



Stephen is prime meat.
Not so fast, buster. Let's see how it goes for a while.
It's Mikey-boy! This's gonna be a trip!
As soon as I can see it again, I'm gonna kill it!
Give me a break! It's pointless!
One of the few that don't turn my stomach.
We got hostiles in the vicinity. Not to worry... when I see 'em, I'll kill 'em.
Haven't killed them all yet.

Moments like that make everything worthwhile!
If that's Joey Graham, the runaway, I say we just shoot him. We can tell his mother it was accident.
Well, Miguel, you're obviously serious. You're sending in the best. I like that in a man. Not much else, but I like that.
Goddamn! They're all dead! I'll have to deal with the disappointment.
It's not all here. Someone better fess up to this now, or I'm going to start shooting at random until someone does.
Some people just beg ya to do it.
Now there's a pet for me.
So, I hope you all learned something from this. You can fix anything with a gun. The bigger the gun, the faster things get resolved. You'd think they teach that at school. Oh, yeah, good work everyone.
They backed out. Obviously they knew what they were up against. Pussies.
I'm crashin'. I'll let ya know when I'm up.
Goddamn, I hate getting up. I'm back on the job!
Yeah, well hang on, pussy. I got the same situation here.
Gotta get this motherloving goddamn thing fixed.
There's a trap here, and I ain't biting.
Huh? Motherloving, son-of-a... not gonna fool me. That doesn't look right.
I ain't never been wet, and I don't intend to start now. Need to get my ass outta this water!
I'm here. What the hell am I supposed to do now?

I've seen your results, little boy. You can't give me what I need. You can't even keep up with me. Hire one of the wimps instead. They're more your speed.
No way, Jose. I know your death rate. I think you're in cahoots with the enemy.
Sorry, it's my weekend to take the kids. I miss this one and my goddamned ex'll get all my visitation rights yanked. Blows, doesn't it?
No dice, I'm moving. Man, you gotta let me know ahead of time.
Meltdown. If this is something I want to hear, leave me a message. Otherwise, hang up now. Fair warning.
It's your call. We're square. See ya.
Guess again, bozo. I don't work with little Biffy. He's a scared little boy who oughta be home takin' care of his mama.

Not a chance in hell. What do you need me for? You've got that trembling little bowl of jelly, Flo. I'm sure she'll be a huge help. If you want me, dump her.
My contract's almost over. You up for more, or have I scared you off yet?
Good enough. I'll stick.
All right. Deal.


Well... I don't know. I guess, since you've got Stephen on the team. He's kind of a prig, y'know, but he's cute enough. All right, could be a kick.
Renew with YOU? HAH! Do I look like a goddamned masochist?
Hey, numbnuts. I said...
I don't take checks, I don't take credit cards, and you don't have the cash. Where do think that leaves us?
Screw it. I don't need you. YOU need ME. You just ain't figured it out yet. You'll come crawlin' back and then we'll see what's what.
No way, Jose. I know your death rate. I think you're in cahoots with the enemy.
Guess again, bozo. I don't work with little Biffy. He's a scared little boy who oughta be home takin' care of his mama.

Yeah, Meltdown. This about a job?
I still have a photo of the first person I ever killed.
Gee, another heavy breather. You guys are so twisted.
So what kind of deal you looking for?
Don't call me if all you're gonna do is leer at me. Or, I'll find out where you live, and I'll kill ya.


Hey Attention Span, my contract turns sour soon. Just thought you might like to know the amount of time we can enjoy each other's company is limited.
Effin' A'! I'm feeling good! About time I get a raise! Cough it up there Bunny Balls. You know I'm worth it. And I know where you live.

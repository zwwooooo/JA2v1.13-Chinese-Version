There's the enemy.
The army! I knew we'd see them sooner or later.
I've got my hands full.
Another of Deidranna's pets.
Deidranna's got to be behind those things. Mother nature isn't that diabolical.
We have to put an end to those things.
What was that?
Their odor is as sweet as their intentions.
Trouble's coming. I can feel it.
This place, it-it looks like a hangout for those things.
Those things are flippin' pains in the ass!
There's stuff.
Look here!
Gun's out of bullets.
I'm in serious pain... send a letter to my family in Brooklyn. Tell them I died bravely - died fighting for the oppressed.
Poor Dimitri - he fought for his family. He fought selflessly for his country.
Miguel's dead! This is terrible! Terrible news! Who will rule Arulco when it is finally free?

I'm not sure I understood.
Flippin' gun doesn't want to work!
Need a distraction!
Maybe I should just go home.
Whew... too close for comfort.
I'd be really pleased with myself if I could hit it.
I've been hit.
Ahh... falling asleep on my feet.
The pace is too much! I have to slow down.
Take that!
One thing less!


That Malice person makes my skin crawl.

Oh my God! That's so revolting!
I'll go in, but I was never what you'd call a fish in water. I like dry land.
I'm all done.
I have other plans.
I've dreamt of this moment for years. It feels wonderful!
God! I hope that was the mother of all those things.
Some people just haven't got a clue.
I thought this would be exciting. I thought I'd be working with professionals. How naive.
Don't be fooled. Not everyone in Arulco is like that.
Flippin' air attack! When will the harrassment cease?
I can't believe this! I got better supplies working with the rebel force.

I know I am American, but I dislike them. You don't see American forces down here liberating these people, do you? Who do you think armed Deidranna?
I'm learning.
That doesn't make any sense.
I'm not surprised.


Good show, Dimitri!
That's why Miguel is the leader.



I can't see a flippin' thing.
I'm useless. Maybe someone else can help.
People like that are why I stayed in Arulco.
We have company. Deidranna's men are around.
I'm sure we didn't find all of Deidranna's men.

Now - that was special!
It's Joey, the runaway kid. Let's get him.
Fine by me. But I don't think you're making the wisest decision.
We've eliminated all of Deidranna's men in this area.
Someone's thieving the stuff. And that's something... Pablo has a reputation for.
That's a step forward for Arulco. Trust me when I say that the people will appreciate this little act.
Oh God... It's one of those bloodcats.
You know, much as I had my doubts, Miguel believed in you. And now I know why. Nice work.
We're clear. They must've pulled out.
Grab some sleep, and I'll get back to work.
Still a little fuzzy, but I'm back working.
I was just thinking that.
Oh, this figures. Piece of junk is broken.
Whoa! I got something wired here.
Careful. That's a nasty little how-do-you-do.
God! Get me outta here! Help! No... I... don't...
I made it. Let's do something already.

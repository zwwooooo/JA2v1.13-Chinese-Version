Enemy soldiers.
Armies of enemy show their face.
I am in deep mule cake.
Insect of terror.
It be bug, yes. Insect from bad movie.
They will eat every one of our people if they are not destroyed.
Noise. Is close.
It be smell of refried bean-fed, dying dog.
It most dangerous here. Must be careful.
I feel insects of terror be close.
They are too many. I feel doomed.
What be there?
There be something.
Need to recharge bullets.
Much suffering... death be waiting.
Miguel was brother to me. We have seen much together. Everything be okay. Carlos now be in charge.
Dimitri was good friend. But I must say, I be surprised he lived this long.
I respect Ira. It be sad she dead. She fight with us because of her heart. Arulco, you know, not be her country of birth.
Not thinkin' good.
It be bad gun. Bring death to Carlos.
They know it be me. They have much reason to kill Carlos.
Why must it be me, always.
Santa Maria. She protects me.
It be difficult. Most difficult.
I am wounded.
I be very tired.
I be in search of breathing.
Traitor be dead.
Terror be gone.
I do not trust Iggy. He was enemy, now friend. What is he tomorrow? I cannot be sure.



It does not bother me. Years of war have left me without heart.

I look for orders.
I will not do this.
Finally, we have removed her from our country. I pray the devil urinates forever on her soul.
Mother of terror did much harm to my country. Her death be most welcome.
Why must people like this be with us.
I am not sure of this agreement. It better when I fight for Miguel.
Arulco's people are much better than this.
She sends airplanes against us.
I think joining mercenary team get me better supplies. I was making mistake.
Sometimes I feel defeating Deidranna is not possible.
I love woman, but their place be with children.
I become smarter.
It does not feel smart.
Miguel would never make a mistake like this.


I respect Miguel. He earns this.
Good, Dimitri. Very good.
For woman, Ira is most capable.


I will never see again!
It does not work for me.
Most people of Arulco are friendly like this.
Her military force is present.
They are still here. There can be attack any time.
I never think I be so lucky to find something like this. It is a bad sign.

It is boy of lady Graham. We must capture him.
I join up with rebel forces.
We triumph! The enemies... they be dead.
Now people steal from us. Everything is not here.
The people of Arulco be better without her. She was bad, mean, selfish woman.
I HATE bloodcats...
This day brings much glory to me. The people of Arulco be free, and for this, we have thanks to you. You did what you came to do.
Is it possible? The enemy have fled.
With sleep, I be all right.
I be back to job now.
Then I am not the only one.
How can we win with bad equipment like this?
No, no. It is set to kill me.
Stop. That no look good.
Oh... Maria... the water... it is too fast... for my country... I try...
Okay, I make it safely. I wait for orders.

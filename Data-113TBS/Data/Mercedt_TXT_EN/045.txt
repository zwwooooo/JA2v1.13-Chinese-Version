More bad news.
They're heee-eere.
My ass is grass!
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo...
God, that's awesome. Spielberg himself couldn't have come up with something like that. Wonder what he'd pay for some of its DNA.
I've seen enough movies to recognize the telltale signs of a mutant creature attack when I see one.
Uh-oh, I didn't like the sound of that.
<sniff> Ahh, I love the smell of mutant flatulence...
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
I've got that same sense of impending doom I got from the first two Alien movies. But not the third one. It sucked.
I'll never get out of this alive!
Any chance that thing's usable?
What do we have here?
Gun's empty.
I think I'm dying... I see a bright light... oh, God, tell me this is just special effects...



Whoa! Vertigo! Where was I?
What the... my gun's screwy!
I'll blow you all to kingdom-come!
Just like elementary school all over again.
Wow, your whole life really DOES flash before your eyes!
I don't feel confident about this one.
There's red stuff here... hey, it's blood... REAL blood... MY blood!
I can't go on without sleep. I'm not a robot, y'know.
I gotta stop and breathe for a minute. I tried smoking, you know.
Better you than me!
Hah! Back to the bottom of the food chain!




Wow... just like in "Scanners." That was too cool.
How does anyone concentrate in this heat? It's like working in a blast furnace!
Anything else?
No, man, no, no way, not me.
Holy cow, she's dead!
I did it. I DID IT! I'm gonna sell the movie rights and make a goddamn FORTUNE!
What a loser! Even I'm not THAT bad.
This is miserable. I can't wait to get outta here.
Buncha disgruntled Post Office rejects, that's what this team is.
Enemy planes approaching! We've had it!
Hey, let's sell these lousy supplies for scrap and split the take.
We're gonna die here. At least if we surrender, they might let us live.

It's a start, anyway.
Can you say "stupid"?
Just too clever to work.





I'm not even getting paid for this! So why am I laying my life on the line? Forget you. I'm taking a powder.

This is scary! I can't see anything!
How's about giving me something I CAN do.
He reminds me of somebody. Not really sure who...
There are enemy forces present in this sector.
I hate it when you know they're out there, yet all's quiet.

Just call me Harry. Dirty Harry!
That kid matches the description Mrs. Graham gave us. I bet any money that he's Joey.
Well, it's your decision. Should have gotten an autograph though. Someday, it'll be worth money. I'm telling you.
Last one down! That was better than Reservoir Dogs, man!
It's not all herrreeeee...
Trust me, in the script of life, she needed to be written out. We didn't have a choice.
Warning! Warning! Will Robinson!
And as the credits roll, our budding star sits sweating in the tropical heat imagining the air-conditioned day when his friends will say, "Yes, I knew that great man." I promise, I'll get you all backstage.
Ah, they took off. Extras. You can't count on them.
I need to sleep. I perform much better with my eyelids open.
Exactly what I needed. I'm picking up where I left off.
Yeah, me too!
The props here are useless. Gotta fix this.
Stand back. If there's one thing I know, this is a trap.
Whoa, careful pilgrim. Looks mighty suspicious 'round these parts.
Too... much... water... Bones...
I'm on location. Ready for the next scene.

Enemies.
That's what I've been waiting on.
Problems here.
Mega-maggot over there.
That's one well-fed maggot.
It's the work of those monster maggots.
Wonder what that noise was.
(sniff) Those maggots can sure pass some mean gas.
Big trouble's comin'. Yeah...
Place is probably swarming with maggots.
I got maggots crawlin' up my ass here!
Someone drop something?
Lookit.
Gotta reload.
I'm fading, need help.


Poor Nails.
Whoa... What was I doing?
Uh-oh, jammed gun here.
C'mon, you sons o' bitches! Is that the best you can do?
Looks worse than it is.
Startin' to get exciting.
Probably just waste ammo.
Gotta do something about this bleeder before I need a freakin' transfusion.
Gotta catch some z's.
Gotta stop. Chest pain.
Lie still.
Dead bag of pus.


Maybe we should just cut the dead weight. Ain't that right, BIFF??
I wasted Mike. Not bad, huh?
Looks better without a head anyway.

Done here.
You know what you can do with THAT order, don't-cha?
Too bad I hadda kill her. She was my kinda gal... feisty.
Maggots lost their mommy!
I'm sick of that goddamned dumbass.
Gonna think twice before I lay my ass on the line for this outfit.
Great team, if you don't mind pullin' their redhot butts out of the fire every ten minutes.
Bombers!
We'd be better off throwing this cheap crap away and fighting hand-to-hand, bare-ass naked.
I don't believe in an eye-for-an-eye. Someone takes out my eye, I take out both of his.

Hard work and clean living pays off.
Freakin' brilliant.
Totally unpredictable.




Nails done good.
Not ready yet.
That's Mike. Good Merc. Too bad.
I can't see a damn thing!
Forget this!
Seemed all right.
From what I'm picking up, the sector's got a few too many people.
Some of them got lucky. Probably still close-by, I bet.

Nailed the sucker!
Could that be the missing kid over there? I should teach him to respect his mother.
Well, she's gotta another thing coming.
We fried 'em all. Got room to move around.
Shipment looks shy of a full load.
Nothing like poppin' it to someone who begged for it. They'll probably give us the key to the town.
Trophy sighting!
Yeah, good job. You need a job done right, you know who to call.
Looks like they didn't want to stay and play.
Gotta saw some logs before I punch someone. I'll be up in a bit.
Sleep makes me nice. And, yeah, I'm working.
You're not alone, pal.
This piece of... has shit the bed.
Whoa. Gotta nasty surprise here.
Lookit. Don't look good.
I... can't... float... much longer!
I'm here. What next?

Nothing burns me up more than a C.O. who doesn't know how to treat his guys. Call me when you figure it all out.
I don't do battle for reckless C.O.'s.
Sorry, I'm doin' an interview with "Soldier of Fortune." Try me again later.
Can't make it happen. Give me some warning next time.
John Peters. Not here right now. Leave a message.
Okay, I'm history.


No! You got Biff Apscott on the team. Looks like a carrot, fights like a pussy.
My contract's closin' down. You interested in doing something about it?
You got it.
I'll be there.


You got Nails signed up. That's good. That balances out your downside. Okay, you got it.
What, sign up for more of the same? In your dreams.
Once more...
Ya, right! What are you going to pay me with?
Ya, okay. That's it, then.
I don't do battle for reckless C.O.'s.

Yes?
I like to break people's necks. Maybe you could use a guy like that.
You there or what?
For how long?
Call me when you're ready to do business. I'll think about answering.


Yeah, getting near that time. Contract's closin' down.
Ya gotta pay more to get more. And I'm more now.

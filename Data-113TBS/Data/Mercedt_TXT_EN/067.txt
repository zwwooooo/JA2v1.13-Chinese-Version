Looking at trouble.
I knew it couldn't stay quiet forever.
Oh, boy...
Bug beast.
That's one heck of a scary looking thing.
Those bugs are going to devour this whole country.
What did I hear?
<sniff> Place smells like a neglected barn.
I wish they'd just show themselves. I hate this feeling.
It's sort of spooky around here.
These bugs are driving me crazy.
Might need that.
Here's stuff.
I need to find ammo fast.
With a little bit of luck... I might just pull through this. But god, it hurts.
Dynamo's dead? That man was like a father to me. Saved my butt in Tixa. Literally.

They got Ivan? That guy was unbelievable. Trust me, they can get anyone of us.
I'm a little confused.
I think there's a bullet stuck in my gun.
I need cover fire!
I didn't deserve that.
That was all too real.
I'm no expert, but can I really be expected to make that shot?
I could use some first aid.
I'm beat. I need to catch some winks.
Pace is brutal, can't catch my breath.
Discharged.
Feels good.




I don't think I ever want to see that again. Actually, I know I don't!
Water gives me nightmares. I saw a couple of my cousins go under when I was young. I haven't been comfortable since.
I'm done.
Can't you find someone else?
Too much! My name shall be etched in the history of this country forever. Breeham Druz, savior of Arulco.
I killed the beast. Be kinda sharp to have one of those antennas, wouldn't it?
Dipshit!
I'm not a professional, I know that. But this isn't half as exciting as I thought it would be.
Okay... so Arulco has its share of idiots. Just like any other country.
Airborne!
I know I'm not a great mercenary, but do I always have to get the leftovers?
The worst is behind us. It's smooth sailing from here on in.

I'll be a pro in no time.
There has to be a better way.
Pretty much the only result possible.


Dynamo hums!

Is this Ivan unbelievable or what?
I'm wondering when I am going to see the money you promised me.
You're laughing at me. I'm never going to see any money, am I? I'm going to work with the rebels.
Ahhh! The bug beast blinded me...
I'll be an old man before I ever get that.
It's nice to get some cooperation for a change.
I'm detecting an army presence.
The army is still close by.
Wow! I can't believe my luck.

It's Joey Graham. Let's not go too hard on the kid. I know where he's coming from.
I can't believe you aren't keeping me. Twenty measly bucks. You can't find twenty measly bucks?
Right on! Army lost another battle. None of them left alive.
I don't think it's all here. This is just like in prison, except there, I knew who took it.
She woulda made a good warden. And a good warden is a dead warden.
AHHHH! Bloody Bloodcat.
Hey! I did it, er, we did it! That make me a hero in your book? You know, I can't wait to see the look on my parents' faces when I tell them, ah, not that I really care.
The army musta retreated. There's no one here anymore.
I'm going to crash for a bit. I'll work again when I get up.
Okay, I'm on the job.
Read my mind. I was just thinking that.
This thing just isn't working right at all.
Hey! This could kill me!
Careful. I have a bad feeling about this area.
The... current.. gotta get out! Hey!.. someone... anyone... I can't... swim.
Okay, I'm here. Now what?

Target.
It's time to spring into action.
This isn't going smoothly! I need help!
Copepods!
Oh my God! That's... well, phylum Arthropoda, class Crustacea, but... what are they? Krill? Brine shrimp? Copepods? Jesus, I think they ARE Copepods... only a few thousand times their usual size!
If I had to venture a guess, I'd say this was evidence of a copepod attack. Something you usually only see through a microscope.
What was that? I just heard a noise.
<sniff> Decomposition... bile... those Copepods are the only creatures large enough to create a stink this fetid.
If instinct counts for anything, we're stepping into something bad.
Wish I had some huge plankton-eating fish with me to keep those Copepods away.
They're all around me! What the hell do I do?
Could be important.
Let's see that.
Oh shoot, no ammo.
I don't... want to die... in this hellhole.


Danny, you made meatball surgery look like... poetry in motion. If I could only be half as good as you were. I really wish it hadn't been you...
Sorry, I'm drawing a blank. What do I do again?
It's jammed, my gun is jammed. Perfect.
This is looking bad!
They never mentioned that in the brochure.
I'm... sure... it wasn't as close as it looked.
Doubt I can make that from here.
Uh, need some time to stop the bleeding.
I gotta sleep. I didn't do these kind of hours even when I was an intern.
I'm all out of breath.
One for our side.
Tag 'em and bag 'em.



Mike was the most revered man in all of AIM. I can't believe I killed him. Me!
That's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.
The heat in this place is driving me crazy. And the humidity is unbelievable.
Looking for something to do.
I won't do that. I'm sorry, but... no.
I guess there's a little bit of Kevorkian in all of us!
Whaddaya know? I'm macho! Officially, macho!
What a putz.
This is nothing like I imagined it would be. I thought it'd be, y'know, bearable.
These macho freaks were amusing to be around for, like, the first ten minutes.
Planes, coming in!
There's only so much I can do with equipment like this. And it ain't much.
I gotta keep believing there's a light at the end of this tunnel.

I may make a career out of this after all.
For what it's worth, I don't think that has a chance of working.
I knew that would never work.




See, I had a good feeling about Danny, and I was right!
I might be willing, but let's wait a little longer to see how well this works out. Nothing personal, just being cautious.
Is that Mike? Oh my God, it is!
Oh my God! I've lost the benefit of sight.
I wish I could do this, but it doesn't seem likely.
You can run into some rather interesting people down here.
The enemy is present in the area.
We should be mindful of the ones that are still nearby.
All right! I've never found anything this valuable.

I think we found the runaway teenager.
We are pleased to come to your aid, Miguel. The situation certainly requires our intensive care.
Whaddaya know! They're all dead!
If I recall correctly, we ordered more than this...
I'm supposed to save lives, not take them... and in this case, I believe we saved a great many. She got the medicine she deserved.
Tranquilizer time!
Well, whaddya know! We did it! Wow, I learned more here than I did in the emergency room, trauma and ICU combined... and I owe it all to you. Look, you need any surgery, call me, and I'll do it for free.
The enemies have gone into remission. We're alone.
These intern hours are killing me. I'll take a rest and be up for the next shift.
It was exactly what the doctor ordered. I'm back on the job.
Yes, me too.
Great. This stuff breaks more often than collar bones.
Careful, careful. This is trapped.
I would urge extreme caution. That looks suspect to me.
Someone.... save my ass... STAT!
I'm on site. Where do I go from here...

Oh, I've heard about the way you run things. I don't think I'm up for that kind of grief. At least not this early in my career.
I'm not your man. I want to get more experience but with your survival rate, I'll never get the chance to put that experience to use.
I'm really sorry. My research paper's being published in Lancet, and I want to be around for the publicity.
Oh, I can't. I'm assisting in a combination heart and lung transplant at Mount Sinai, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
This is Michael Dawson, M.D. I'm probably seeing patients right now, so if you leave a message, I'll call you right back. Thanks.
This was great. I learned a lot. Thanks for giving me a chance.



I'll tell ya, my time's just about over. Can I convince you to extend my contract?
Great. This is working out just the way I'd hoped.
You got it. I'll be there with bells on.


Are you kidding? I'd give my right arm to see Danny in action. He's incredible. So yeah, in spite of your... I mean, yeah!
I'm sorry. After what we've been through, I'm thinking I may not be cut out for this kind of work. I'm going to have to do some soul-searching for a while.
Listen carefully...
Apparently, I'm beyond your means.
Was it something I said? Something I did? Or didn't do? Never mind, you don't owe me any explanations. I'll go.
I'm not your man. I want to get more experience, but with your survival rate, I'll never get the chance to put that experience to use.

Michael Dawson, MD.
I know I'm a little green as far as field work, but just put a scalpel in my hand and watch my smoke.
I'm waiting.
How long a contract is this going to be?
Fine. If you don't know what you want, don't waste my time.


Been thinking, you know, my time's just about up here.
Nothing personal, but I was thinking that since my skills have improved, a raise in my fees might just be appropriate.

Got a thug!
Always wanted to do this. And here we go.
Prepare the ICU! I'm in deep!
Got liver here!
I knew I should have stayed back at the hospital. At least there the livers didn't have legs.
This suggests that the livers aren't too particular about what they consume. Just as long as it's human.
Ya hear that?
Phewf! A body cavity search has a better smell.
Gotta feeling I shouldn't be here.
Let's hope the livers had other things to do.
Closing in on me!
What's that?
Have something here.
Outta bullets.
Ugh! I'm hemorrhaging... I won't make it...



Whoa. Had a momentary loss of cognitive function. Where was I?
Gun's jammed up on me.
They got me trapped here!
Now this is gonna bruise...
Way too close for comfort.
What I can't see, I can't hit.
Got an active laceration here.
Some sleep would do me good.
Hold on. I gotta increase my cardio.
One for Arulco!
Yeah, take that, monster!




Oh my, I... oh... I think I'm going to be sick.
I hope we're not going to be in here long. I hate feeling cramped. Puts my... central nervous system on edge.
Task complete. Next?
No way. Have your head examined.
This day, the people of Arulco will celebrate! I had my doubts, but never about this.
She won't be laying any more livers!
I've seen afterbirth with more class.
I should have stayed back at the hospital, but NO, I wanted adventure, excitement. What was I thinking?
All we need is a sign that says, "Mental Ward."
Overhead!
I came along figuring at least I'd get proper equipment. I should have known.


Practice makes perfect!
Perhaps there's a... better way to do that.
Learned something, I hope.





You know, we had agreed I'd get paid for this.
Your continued disregard for my salary is not appreciated. I will not be able to partake in this little adventure. It's back to the hospital for me.
Can't see a thing!
In my opinion, this is futile.
Some nice people here, and I've been around long enough to know.
Got thugs in the area.
Stay sharp. They're still on the loose here.

That's why I joined!
There's the teenager. Let's get him back to the nest.
It's your choice. I did what I could. I hope it was good enough.
We just cleared the emergency room, boys and girls, and filled the morgue. Feels good.
Pablo's been in our stuff. I know it's him. I've treated him for broken knees.
Sometimes, there's only one treatment. And it's best administered quickly.
Watch it! I've treated Bloodcat victims!
I joined for the people. They were only getting sicker. Together, we eradicated the whole damn disease. Great work!
Clear for now. They may be back, though.
I'm exhausted. I'll need some shuteye.
Back on my rounds.
Add me to the list.
Oh, how can I work if this doesn't!
Whoa. Could end up in a body bag.
Easy does it. That looks very questionable to me.
Oh no... can't drown... not here... it's... not fair... it's...
Not sure what I'm supposed to do now that I'm here.

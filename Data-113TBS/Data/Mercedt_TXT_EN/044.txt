Oh, my!
Oh, non, I had hoped we would not be meeting them now!
I want to go home!
Mon Dieu, another one!
Mon Dieu! What in the world is that? I cannot believe it! I do not want to believe it.
Zut alors! The horrible things have been this way!
There is a noise!
I recognize that foul odor! It's the odor of those horrible creatures!
I sense that we are entering the door of danger.
I will just die if I have to see another one of those terrible monsters!
Help! Help!
Look there.
What is that I see?
My gun is void of ammo!
I don't want to die here...not here...don't let me die here.
Mon Dieu, Biff, you can't be dead! My poor Biff! Surely we should turn back now and go home, simply out of respect for Biff, yes?

Oh, Lynx, what a waste! Such beauty, such skill... and your hands, I love your hands... this is too sad, I cannot possibly go on. Perhaps I leave this Godforsaken place now.
The stress is beginning to affect my thoughts...
Now my gun is jammed! This is hopeless!
This is insanity! I'm going to be killed!
For a moment, I thought I was with the angels. Now I find I'm still in this enfer. My suffering knows no bounds.
They have alarmed my fear. I am terrified of death.
That is an impossible target.
Spilling blood for this cursed mission. How much more am I expected to do?
I feel faint. I simply cannot go on without sleep.
The air of Arulco is heavy. I am suffocated.
I killed somebody!
It is dead.


This Meltdown, she is not a woman at all. She is an affront to the female sex!
I cannot stand to be with Meltdown any longer. She is offensive and unfeminine and deserves only contempt. Good luck to you. I want no more of this!
That is revolting!
I don't believe I can go through with this... I am terrified.
Is there something else for me to do?
Absolutely not. I am nobody's dog.
She's dead. By my hand. I sense a feeling of power for the first time in my life. I like it!
All right, she's dead. I must get out of here and shower, or I will never feel clean again.
I hate to waste my brain thinking about that fool.
Right now, I would like to be back in my apartment, taking a hot bath and sipping champagne. Perhaps, I might be inspired to forget I was ever here.
The lowest of the low, the dust of humanity!
Enemy planes heading directly for us!
Don't we deserve something better than these crude implements? I cannot be at war without decent implements!
Mon Dieu! How do I find myself in this... I am terrified. My nerves are frail. I dream of being safe under the covers of my bed.

I make progress, non?
Perhaps there is a method that makes more sense?
I foresaw this! Not that anyone would have listened to me!


Excellent, Biff! Is it any wonder I like you...that is, like working with you so much?

You see now? Trust Lynx!
This job is taxing my sanity and not taxing my pocketbook. I am sorry. I can take this no longer. I leave now.

Merde! I have lost my eyes.
It is my fear that you have asked the wrong person.
Someone I would enjoy knowing more deeply.
The enemy is present.
Hopefully, someone will locate the remaining enemies, so they will no longer be a danger to me, eh... us.

Oh, mon dieu! That was more satisying than an orgasm.
Finalement. We have located the lost boy.
Oh well. It was fun while it lasted, non?
Tres bon! The enemies are no more.
Attend, something is missing here.
She was no good. She deserved all that come upon her and, perhaps, more.
Chat!
I wish there were champagne so we could celebrate with civility. But then, good friends are the most important thing.
The enemy, he has retreated.
I must sleep now. I will be much better when I wake.
I am up now, and starting where I stopped.
Mais oui! Me, too.
I cannot work with this... this stuff. It is broken.
Look! Careful, I think it holds danger.
Hmm. I think the enemy is trying to conceal something terrible.
Mon dieu! I am... drowning!
I have arrived! Something I can do now?

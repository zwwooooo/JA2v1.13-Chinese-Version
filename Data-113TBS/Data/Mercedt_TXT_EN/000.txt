Have company!
Ah, trouble is here!
God, give me strength!
Another one of the nightmares is here.
Please, tell me I am just having nightmares.
Somebody was not so lucky here.
What was that?
This place has stench of the nightmares.
My bowels are clenching for no apparent reason.
This place feels full of nightmares.
So many nightmares! Lord, save me!
What is that?
Ah, look there!
Chamber of gun is empty.
I ask God not to let me die.
Red, I did not want to say goodbye to you. But at least you have died doing what you loved. That is most enviable.


Wait, I have...what is the expression? Cobwebs in the head?
This gun refuses to fire.
They are trying to kill me! But I am professional!
I hurt all over. Next time, I ask more money.
The Lord must have been with me.
I have no clear shot from here.
Oh...I hate the sight of my own blood.
I am spent now. I should rest.
I need to stop. My lungs are small.
Forgive me for taking life.
I enjoy killing these nightmares.



I have killed the great Mike! I do little dance of victory! Heyheyhey!
I have seen men die this way. It nauseates me.
I am like cat! The water...I no like to go in it.
All right, that is finished. I be ready.
I respectfully decline.
I dislike to take life. But this one invited death.
YES! I mean...killing is bad, but...YES! I am hero today!
Some persons it is difficult to respect.
This organization is phooey!
I have no choice but to trust these people with my life.
Attacking from above!
How can I be expected to do good work with equipment like this?

Women should be always treated respectfully, even in places like this.
Ah, there is hope for me yet.
I see great flaws in this plan.
That was easily anticipated.


That Red, he is some terrific, eh? And so colorful.


I do not want to make that commitment yet. We will see.
That is Mike? I do not understand how he can be such a traitor.
I am without vision.
I am having great difficulty. I am of no help.
He is a gentleman.
Enemy exists in region.
Forces are in hiding, but are still close.

Gun is dependable. I am very satisfied with gun.
Is that not boy, Joey Grey?
We are ready to undertake task at hand.
That is it! There is no more enemy.
This shipment is not complete. I am thinking of shooting gun.
I do not feel killing is always good. Yet, sometimes, it is necessary.
Budapest!
Hey hey! We are good! I am happy and pleasured to be a part of this success. Chances have been taken, and I have learned much.
The enemies have retreated from sector.
I do not work well without sleep. I will be just a moment.
I am awakened and active.
Include me on that.
This equipment is no longer in workable state.
Stand back. There is trap there I believe. Perhaps I get to work, no?
Caution. That looks highly dangerous to me.
Lord... <glub> why...
I have reached the destination now.

Others have warned me about you. I am not your man.
I love to play with bombs, but working with you is even too dangerous for me.
I am taking religious holiday. Perhaps another time.
I am giving lecture on mercury-switch timing devices. You must ask me sooner next time.
Hello. This is Barry's telephone response mechanism. I, Barry, am in lab at this moment. Tell me who you are, and I will respond in near future.
It is good I will have some time to play with new plastiques. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to have blown things up for you.



You'll see we have nearly reached the end of my contract. If I've pleased you, maybe we work out a new agreement, yes?
It is my privilege to continue our association.
We have reached simultaneous agreement. Count me as part of your team.
I am not sure about this, but Red has joined you. I like him. So, very well, I have deal.


No, I do not wish to continue. Perhaps I am not right for this kind of work. I find it saddening.
Pardon me, I said...
If you cannot afford to pay me, I cannot afford to work for you.
I would have liked more opportunity to prove myself to you. But it is as you wish. Goodbye.

Hello. Barry Unger. What can be done for you?
I apologize, I sometimes have trouble with the language. You call me for purpose?
This is uncomfortable silence.
How long you want me to work?
Maybe we have phone problem. Try to call me back.


Contract time almost come over.
Skills improve, and so I must improve my price.

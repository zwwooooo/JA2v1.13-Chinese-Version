Target in sight.
We have some inconveniences to dispose of.
Serious snafu here!
Sushi!
That's one badass piece of sushi.
Got a feeling those things did some slicing of their own here.
Think I heard a suspicious sound.
Ugh, pretty rank. Smells like putrid sushi.
Something's out there, man. Something's watching us.
I never cared for those things. And trust me, they're around.
God damn, I need backup.
What's there?
Might be worth a look.
No more ammo.
Took it hard this time...may not walk away from this one.



Sorry, come again? I was spaced.
Gotta jammed gun here, damnit.
They're turnin' up the heat!
Sort of feel like a mosquito that's been slapped.
Comes with the territory.
Need a better vantage point.
Got a bad puncture wound here. Losing blood.
Hittin' a wall here. Gotta sleep.
I...I have to slow down.
Target dispatched.
Eat it raw!




Someone took a little too much off the top.

I'm all done.
No, with all due respect.
Our main target has been dispatched.
YES!! I mean...just doing my job.
One of those mercs we could do much better without.
I expected things to go better than this.
Some people should wise up and realize that mercenary work isn't for everybody.
Air raid! This is not a drill!
This equipment is trash. Should probably just put it out on the curb.


I do what I can.
I think we might want to go over that again.
That was a predictable outcome.






Don't look like we were spotted comin' in. Now we gotta find this Miguel guy.
This better pass quick...I can't focus on a damn thing.
I'll never get that.
You meet all kinds. Some of them actually turn out to be worth meeting.
Heads up. We have a confirmed enemy presence.
They probably haven't strayed too far...

It gets the job done.
Hey, that's that Graham kid.
We're here to prevent that, Miguel. And we got access to the firepower to do it.
That's it for targets! At least for this area.
Hm. Perhaps we should take a closer look at who we deal with. They're skimming off the top.
I'm surprised to hear myself say it, but sometimes there don't seem to be enough bullets... A lot of mothers are gonna be spending more time with their kids.
Bobcat!
Well, we've been in this thing together since the beginning. Been a lot of water under the bridge. Feels like a long time ago. Hell... I almost feel like you gave birth to me. Thanks.
Ah, they took the back door. No one here but us, now.
Taking a rest before I do something foolish. Up in a bit.
Up and back on track now.
Same here.
This thing belongs in the nearest trash can.
Damn! Looks like we got a problem here.
Stay still! See that? Looks suspicious to me.
Hey... there's a un..<gulb>... un...<gulb>... under...<glub>... tow... <glub> here!
Made it intact.

Got one.
Time to get to work.
Coming outta everywhere!
Creeper!
Aye! And I thought they were bullshit...
Have they no mercy?
I'm hearing noises.
<sniff> Must be Brits around...
Feeling a slight reluctance... Could be walkin' into somethin'.
Creepers... not gettin' me, that's all I'm saying.
Blimy things are multiplyin'!
It's mine.
Saw it first.
I need lead.
I'm down... and ya gotta save me. You need me.


Ah, Red, ya feared it would come to this. Such a short friendship, but I'll miss ya, and I appreciate ya leaving me in yer will.
Me thinkin' whiskey. Where was I?
Me gun's stopped up.
Raining bullets and fire! Need a way out!
Feels like the morn after a good fisticuffs.
I saw it coming.
Shoot it? I like to be able to see it.
Need a bandaging immediately! I'm pissin' life's fluid.
I'm dead in me shoes. Need sleep.
I'll not tire meself further for ya.
Yer welcome.
Rot in creeper hell!


Aye, mark me words. Buns is as prissy as they get, and I can't promise to keep me gun calm with her around. Nerves, you know?
That's it! I can't take her and I can't shoot her. You go right ahead an' keep Buns. Hope she'll do right good by ya. I'm outta here.
Shit! I was countin' on a new helmet!

It's done.
Don't think so.
Consider that your goodnight kiss, me lady.
She be the Queen bee! What ya can't tame, ya kill!
There be no water in that creek.
I've had me more fun playing church bingo.
On the market, I wouldn't be seeing 10 pounds for this team.
Planes comin' in!
Don't much like working with second-hand goods, ya know.
Don't much care for company.

Expect I'd get better.
That'd be real smart.
A regular braintrust, that's what it was.




That's it, Red!
Gotta bill here for me services, ya know.
Before you stiff me, ya might wanna consider me friends. *Heh* And yours.
Blinded!
Better luck finding a pot o' gold.
Don't trust anyone.
They're about! And they don't mean me no good.
Don't be foolish. They're still about somewheres.

How's about that there, lad!
There's the little leprechaun! Grab 'em.
Whatever. Can't say as it hurts me much.
Call in the buzzards! They're all dead.
It ain't all here. And I didn't take it. I swear.
Shoulda begged me for your life, Doreen! Woulda added a wee bit of drama.
Jesus! Tomcat!
Can't say I'm surprised. Ya had me, after all. Still, tell ya what. I'll look into gettin' ya some better stuff for the next time.
I'm safe for a bit. They thought it out and left.
I have a condition, so's I'll get some sleep an' work some more.
Coulda used more sleep, but I'm working.
Aye, I thought it first.
Where do you get this bloody crap from? Britain?
Blimey! Coulda got me! It's jigged!
Look at what they done here. It be a good thing I be with ya.
Aye! Blimey water! I'm goin' down...
Finished me excursion. I be in position.

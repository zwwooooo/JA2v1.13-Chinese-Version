More opposition.
Time to take out the trash!
Gotta pull outta here, NOW.
BFS...Big Friggin' Slinky.
Jeezis K. Riest, that is the biggest, grossest goddamn slinky I ever did see!
Slinky's been on a rampage, man.
Just heard a noise!
Whew! That's one stinky slinky, man!
Gettin' the cold sweats. Means something heavy's about to go down.
I think them butt-ugly slinkies are around...
God damn, man, the Big Friggin' Slinkies are everywhere.
Something over there.
What is that?
This gun ain't happenin' 'til I reload it.
Feels like my insides are on fire!



Zoned out for a second. Run that by me again.
Shoot, my gun jammed!

Awright, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Yeah, that coulda been bad, but I got me some kickass karma.
Hey, I'm good, but I'm not sure I'm THAT good.
I'm puttin' pressure on this wound, but it's still bleedin'.
I can't stop yawnin'. I gotta take a catnap, like, now.
Lemme catch my breath, before I pass out!
Tagged ya.
Unslinkified!




Oh, Jesus, now THAT blows my mind. Guess that makes two of us.

Got this wrapped up. Next!
Pff! Get someone else to do it.
HAHAHA! Rest in pieces, you evil thing!
Awright, baby! Big Mama ugly-ass slimy slinky bites the big one!
If there's a worse merc than that scumbag, I ain't met 'em.
Somebody put me outta my misery before I do it to myself, would ya?
This company, talk about scrapin' the bottom of the barrel for mercs!
They're making a bombing run!
I hate going into battle with stuff I can't trust. This is the flimsiest crap I've ever been asked to use.


Some of us just have it.
Gotta be kiddin' me. Wanna do WHAT?
Didn't really expect that to work, didja?






Talk about flying in low. I had to look up to see the squirrels. I'm sure  glad to have my feet planted firmly on the ground. Now, which way to the rebel hideout?
Need a guide. I can't see nothin'!
This just ain't gonna happen.
Those are the kind of people I'm fighting for.
This is a guaranteed combat area. Got enemies.
Remember, there's at least one hiding somewhere nearby.
Bingo. It's just like Christmas.

That's the milk carton kid! Joey whatever...
Not if we take her out first. Let me tell ya, most women I take out don't even know how to read a map.
Yeah! This is an enemy-free zone.
We've been short-shipped or finger-slipped! Either way, there's stuff missing.
It was either that or an armful of Midol. And I didn't see no pharmacies. Don't sweat it, we'll be heroes around here.
Pussy!
Yeah! Now that's the way to show 'em who's boss! And, man, let me tell ya, you've come a long way since we landed in Omerta. It was good to be part of it.
Ah, they're up to something else now. Not here anymore.
Grabbing a catnap 'fore I smack my head off the floor.
Yup, I'm back on it.
Deal me in, too!
It's broken! How 'bout we stop shopping outta dumpsters?
That thing's wound up tight enough to take an arm.
Hey, would ya look at that? Don't look right to me.
I'm going down... fast!
End of the road. I'm just standing here waitin'.

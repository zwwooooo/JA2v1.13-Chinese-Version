Rivals.
Let the games begin.
Gotta turn things around.
Bug!
Blowing those things away is gonna be a whole lot of fun. Hahhaha.
Those bugs sure do get around.
Sure I heard a sound. A bad sound!
Whoa! Ain't nothin' I know that smells quite like that!
Starting to smell a rumble.
Wouldn't mind killing me another bug right about now.
Hahhaha. These bugs are going to get it.
What's that?
Is it worth it?
Bullets be handy, man.
Oh, man... I'm toast.
Fox bought it? That's too bad. She was a hot chick.

They got Bull? Man... musta used an elephant gun.
Clued out, man.
Misfire.
They got my number.
I've been beaten by chicks worse than that.
Hahaha... You'll have to do better than that.
Ain't looking easy, Scooter.
Sight of my own blood makes me nauseous, man.
I'm zapped. Need to crash.
Ehhho - Man... I gotta cut back on the beer and cigarettes.
Suck my exhaust!
Hahaha... Wiped out.
Biff's driving me nuts! Maybe I could just rip out his vocal cords. Course, I'd have to catch him first.


There... that wasn't so tough.
Not much chance of picking up the pieces there.
I ain't crazy about tight places, man. This place is givin' me the sweats.
I'm done here.
Forget it, Scooter!
You're a carcass now, sweetheart.
Hahaha... grandma roach is cooked.
What a doorknob.
I'm really not into this...
Dealing with idiots down here.
Sky bandits!
The stuff I'm using should be in a museum.

Piss me off! Some people just think they're better than others. And they're usually wearing suits.
I'm catching on.
That ain't the way I'd go about it.
I won't tell anyone, Scooter.
Ah, man. What were you thinkin' when you brought that chicken boy, Biff, down here. His whining gives me migraines.

Talent and beauty. Gotta love it.

My man Bull!
Ahhh... not sure what I'm doing yet. We'll talk again.
All right! The chance to kill Mike!
Flamin' eyeballs! God damn thing's blinded me.
This ain't gonna happen.
Someone with a head on their shoulders.
There's rivals hanging out in the area.
We haven't eliminated the other club yet. Nobody get stupid!
Don't mess with the vest, Scooter!
It's you and me, baby.
There's the kid. Gonna drag him back to his mother by his short hairs.
Rebel force! Right on, Scooter. Let me tell ya, I'm a rebel from way back. Your business is my business, Mike. I'm your man.
Last puke wasted. I don't even know why they show up.
Hey! Some of the parts is missing here, Scooter.
You know, had I had the time, I woulda taught the chick a thing or two, maybe we coulda salvaged her. But something had to be done and done quick for the sake of the kids.
Seatcovers!
This is the life, Scooter. Just kick back, grab a brew and take it all in. We kicked some nasty ass! Cause ya put a nasty group of guys together. Catch ya on life's highway, man.
They took off, man...
Gonna do a short coma, man.
All right. I'm back standing vertical. Gonna finish up what I was doing.
I'm in on that, Scooter.
What I'm carrying here is piece of garbage. And I can't get nothing done with a piece of garbage.
Sit tight. This thing's loaded and ready to blow.
Hey, watch your step. Enemy's been on their knees playing around.
Scoot...errr... I can't keep... my head...longer...
Road trip's over, man.

We got a problem, Scooter. From what I hear, you haven't got a clue what you're doing.
I could flip a coin as to whether I come back from Arulco alive. I'm looking for better odds than that, Scooter.
Could use the cash, but I gotta rally, man.
Headed home, Scooter. Made other plans.
Nails. Talk to me, I'll listen to ya later.
Keep my name in mind, Scooter.
If I spend another minute with Biff, I'll kill him. It's that simple. So out of respect for Speck, I'm gonna pass on your offer.


We're coming up on the end of this contract, Scooter. What's the crystal ball telling ya?
Yeah... I could get into it for a little longer.
We got a deal. I'd shake your hand but these contraptions ain't quite at that point yet.
Hey, the Fox is in Arulco, I'm in Arulco. You can bank on that.

With Bull signed on, I'm signed on. He's kick-ass! I like that.
Scooter, I'm gonna go home, take something strong, crash on the couch with the TV on, and forget I was ever here.
Concentrate, Scooter. I was telling ya...
Your bank is making like they don't know ya, Scooter. Consider everything, ...off.
Ya needed a specialist, huh, Scooter. Someone to get the job done and get out.

Nails.
Not too many people know this, but I can open just about anything you can lock.
I got shit to do...
What we talking, Scooter?
The silence is killing me, Scooter. I gotta run.
Okay, I'll work with Biff this time but keep in mind that I hate his guts. The less I see him the better. He irritates the crap out of me.

It's almost time for me to split, Scooter.
When the tough get going, the price goes up. I gotta new bottom line, Scooter.

More evil peoples.
I spy the evil peoples.
Goddamn it to hell!
Ooh, monster!
Jesus and Mary. I would not have thought such monsters existed.
A monster was here.
I hear noise close by.
Ouwah, the stench of the monsters revolts me.
The hairs on the back of my neck are, umm, upstanding.
I pray the monsters are not here.
Monsters to the right! Monsters to the left! Goddamn!
What is that?
There's something there.
Gun is empty, dammit to hell!
My life is, uhh, flushing before my eyes.


This man Grizzly was larger than life to me. God save his soul. God save all our souls. Amen.
I forget...what am I thinking? Damn, damn, DAMN!
Gun is jamming up on me. Oohw!
Stupid fools push me too far!
They hardly lay hand on me... Oh, tooth come out.
That make my blood sing...
If I miss, it is okay?
My skin is punctured and leaking.
Need sleep to keep up strength.
I have no breath. It will pass.
Another falls before me.
The monsters are not so tough.
Something stinks. Maybe is Ivan? All his people have stench of tyranny.
If you find me dead with a knife in my back, I tell you now it is Igor. He is treacherous.

Mike thought he be immortal. He did not figure on meeting a Gontarski.
Repulsive. But no pain, I guess.

My assignment has come finished. What to do now?
Find someone else to do that.
Ah, she was only a woman. Naturally I am superior.
I assume I get big bonus for this.
That is not mercenary, that is dirt beneath my feet.
The way this outfit is run, I do not like.
They make bad team. Bad decisions. It should be me in charge.
Trouble in the sky!
There is limit to what I can do with these goddamn cheap supplies.
When in doubt, think, "What would Gontarski do here?"
I think of Russia like my mother, both could die I would not care.
At this rate, I soon be perfect.
This is not idea, this is fantasy.
As you say... "Back to drawing board," eh?
You want Ivan on your team? Then you DON'T want ME. I would stay behind if I had known you would let him to join.
I do not work with Communist like Igor. I stick to contract, but after that, if Igor still here, I make thought to leave.


Hehehehe... Grizzly is not bad, eh? I knew this.
No no no, not yet. Have to work out together more, yes?
Hey hey! Mike's here! Hahaha, now we see who is better man!
Dammit to Hell! I do not see what is going on.
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! This is not possible!
Now... this guy I like. He good guy.
Peoples of evil be here!
We must not forget that we have left our enemies hiding.
Grandma Gontarski blesses me from above with great riches.

Look! It is that wild kid we are looking here and there for.
Miguel, I am "the man." These are other people. I will make her surrender to me in many ways.
Ha ha ha! All evil has been lifted and separated.
Dammit to hell! I do not see everthing here.
She was bad woman, and she die for the good of all people here.
Oh Mary!!
We did all of them good! Finished and evil is dead! Goddamn! This mean more money for me, yes?
Evil people cower like children in retreat. They catch wind of Gontarski, no doubt.
My lids close. I will sleep for you and be better.
I have arisen. Amen.
Me too, yes?
Dammit to hell! This is broken junk!
Stop! A large boob trap is present.
Slow! There is danger on ground there.
Grandma... I am... engulfed by the seas...
I took my hike. What now?

I apologize. Your reputation makes me, umm, discomfortable.
I am not a person with, umm, death wish. Perhaps you can improve, yes? Telephone me when better.
I going to Chicago. Is Pulaski Day celebration. I see you other time.
Uhh, Pope is making first visit to hometown. You let me know more time ahead next time, eh?
Robert Gontarski is, umm, unavoidable right now. Tell me who you are and what you want, and maybe I put him in touch with you, maybe not.
I thank you for, umm, giving me the business. I see you.
I don't work with Ivan. His people...hmm, I have nothing good to say.
No, no, no, you have Igor Dolvich on team. I sooner work with Germans.

My contract is, umm, up yours for renewal if you like job I do for you.
Very good! I am yours again.
It is an agreement!


The arrangement is not ideal. But I like to work beside Mr. Bornell. All right.
I am tired of your ways of working. I look elsewhere now.
I say again...
Without the, mmm, money to pay, I don't work.
You dismiss me quickly, but you too will see. It is mistake.
I am not a person with, umm, death wish. Perhaps you can improve, yes? Telephone me when better.

This is Steroid Gontarski speaking.
If I work with your team, I whip other members into shape damn quick.
What you waiting for me to say?
How long you want me?
You decide if you want me to work, then you call.
I need job, so I say yes. But you must understand that I not like Ivan Dolvich. Please keep many trees between us.
To be forced to work with Igor Dolvich is to me displeasing. Please make him sit in corner by himself, not by me.
My contract is almost at, hmm, finish line.
I have been pushed from bottom up, and so now raise my rate of benefits.

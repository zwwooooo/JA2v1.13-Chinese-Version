Soldiers.
I knew they weren't too far.
I need help. Fast!
Hellbug!
Holy Toledo! I heard of 'em, but I ain't never seen one...'til now.
There was a rumor that Deidranna had a way of disposing bodies so they'd never be found. I got a feeling those Hellbugs are involved.
What made that noise?
That's the same odor I smelled in the prison.
I'm feeling uncomfortable. Need to keep my head...
Those Hellbugs better be sleeping.
Hellbugs! All over the place.
Something there.
Might be useful...
I ain't got any bullets left.
Don't look good... Don't think I'll get my chance at revenge. Tell my wife I'm sorry about our son. I pray she forgives me.
I liked Shank. He'd come a long way from that spoiled rich kid who showed up that night in Tixa. Even gave him his nickname. Breeham would have got him killed in there.

Gonna miss Blood. Can't say I knew him a long time, but I liked what I knew.
Mind was in Tixa for a minute. Give me it again.
Something's wrong! Gun won't fire.
It's rainin' bullets.
I've had worse done to me while I slept.
You don't hit me, you don't scare me.
I can barely see it!
They took a chunk outta me. Probably need bandaging.
I'm spent. Looking to sack out a bit.
Lung capacity ain't what it was...
See ya.
Buzz off!


That animal Bubba is an ignorant S.O.B. Wish someone would just shoot him.

Make your stomach turn.
Gonna get that broad Deidranna. Ain't nothin' gonna stand in my way but death.
I'm finished. I'm ready.
I'm not into it right now.
That was for my son, you Nazi bitch! May the devil reject your soul.
Got the momma!
Dunghead.
Things ain't goin' right. Maybe I should go at this myself.
Don't trust nobody. I know, I was born in this country.
Those planes are headed right for us.
I guess it's part of the pecking order. The local guy gets the crap supplies.
Wish we'd pick up the pace. I got a date with Deidranna.
I hate to put a whole group of people in one despicable bunch. But every Hungarian who ever stepped into Arulco has caused nothing but trouble.
I'm gettin' better.
Haven't got a clue what that's gonna accomplish.
Stuff like that scares me.


You've done good, Shank!

Liking you more every day, Blood.
Hey! Where's my money?
I wasn't asking for much. Just a couple of bucks worth of respect. See ya. I'd rather take a go at her myself.
Burnt my eyes! Can't see nothing!
I just can't do it.
A sympathizer.
There's soldiers buzzin' around.
Deidranna's soldiers are still around. I won't rest 'til we get 'em all.

Packs a punch!
That's Mrs. Graham's boy. I'd give anything to have mine back.
That wasn't part of the plan. I got business with Deidranna.
They're all out of their misery. Though I wouldn't mind killing another one.
Didn't figure on this. Someone's looting our supplies. I'd put my money on Pablo. I've heard he's got connections to the black market.
I can't stand to see someone abuse children. She wasn't Deidranna, but she was too close for comfort.
Prison rat!
This isn't about me, you understand. This is about my son. You might not ever know the peace I feel right now, but let me tell you, you're a major part of it.
Damn it! They got away. Left us to do as we please.
I'm hitting the sack. Be up in a few.
I'm punched in.
Yeah, I'm in the same way.
Can't afford to have this happen. It needs to be fixed.
This is just waiting to blow someone up.
Look closely... It's got "trouble" written all over it.
No... no... tell my wife.. I... I... died... trying...
I'm waiting on new orders here.

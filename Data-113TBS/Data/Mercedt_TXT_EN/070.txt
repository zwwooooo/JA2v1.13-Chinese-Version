Sighting!
Have enemy in view!
I may need help!
Remain calm! Is just bug.
What the hell is that? Is some kind of joke? Wait. Remain calm. I will be in charge here.
Leftovers.
Shh, a noise.
This smell can't be good for me, or anyone.
No need to be nervous. I am in charge.
Could be more bugs in area. I suggest killing them quickly.
One at time, no rush, you will all die!
Object.
I found it.
No bullets! Need better planning.
Drop everything! I require medical attention!
Iggy, you were a valiant servant. Rot in peace.

Oh, Stephen. Too bad you die. You had potential.
Focus. Focus. Where was I?
Jammed! Need better maintenance.
I have no fear!
It was nothing.
Obviously, I did not train them.
Anyone with half brain would not attempt this shot.
Blood. Must stop it.
Need sleep. Now.
Wait. I catch my breath.
Defeated. Of course.
I am good!


There is no room on this squad for drug abusers like Larry. I refuse to be in the company of such ingrates. They are not trainable.
I have reached my limit for Roachburn. I will take my leave now! Obviously, you do not realize how important I am.
It was nothing. I teach people how to do this!
Water is no place for a soldier, unless in boat.
Assignment completed.
Not on your life.
She is dead. I am happy. She never pay me on time.
The big creature is dead.
Not an acceptable human.
This is the kindergarden of military training.
If only they would use me as an example. Maybe then, this entire thing could improve.
Overhead!
Apparently, someone has forgotten that I am one of the best military men alive and, as such, should get the top equipment available.
Everybody looks up to me. I sign autographs sometimes.

I am not surprised. I train toward perfection.
I see you have had no formal instruction.
The outcome was on the first page. In very big letters.


Iggy, you are good.

Stephan, good job.
There has been an oversight... I have not been paid.
I am leaving. I should have known this outfit was not properly trained OR financially secure! Goodbye!
I can't see! Remain... calm comrade.
My training is not of use.
Hm. Properly motivated...
Enemies are in the area.
Remember, just because we don't see them does not mean that we can rest. Stay alert! Listen to me.

In a master's hands, you see what you can do?
There is the young man. Get him!
Not a wise decision. Obviously, you were not paying attention to my greatness.
Well done. All enemies are ready for box.
This is not acceptable. The thief will die for this.
She is dead. She deserved it. There is nothing left to see here.
A bloodcat!
Obviously, it was my supreme military background which achieved this win. Thank you for... for what, I am not sure, but thank you.
The enemies have fled. They were unprepared to stay and fight.
I require sleep before I continue my work.
I have resumed my assignment.
Me too, and I am more important.
What? I must be given functional tools to do job.
There is trap. It must be disarmed.
My fine skills have alerted me to danger. I am good.
I cannot swim... No! Not drowning, oh god!... <glub> Remain..<glub> calm... Swallow less...
I am in position. What great task shall I undertake now?

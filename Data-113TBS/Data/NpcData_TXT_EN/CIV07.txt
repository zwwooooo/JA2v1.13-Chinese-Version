Don't shoot me.
Mommy says you are very bad people.
I'm scared... Don't hurt me.
I don't like you.
Why don't ya leave us alone?
We don't want you here, army.
My dad says the army is gonna fix ya.
Nobody likes ya here.
Everybody hates you.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
My uncle says you won't be here long.
Why you doing this to us?
Leave me alone.
The Queen will get ya.
You're in big trouble.

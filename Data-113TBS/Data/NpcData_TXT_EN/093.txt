Name's Spike. I'm in charge of customer service.
Ya, what?
Yer not from around here, are ya?
Did ya check out Madame Layla's yet? Nice girls...
Don't need it!
Ya want to know something, ya ask Mr. Van Haussen.
Ya looking to get your ass kicked?
I already got a job.
I can't move too good...
Take a hike.
A tip... It must be my smile.
Maybe this will make ya understand.
Yer goose is cooked!
What ya doing here? Mr. Van Haussen told ya it's closing time!
I'll get him, Boss.
You took money from Kingpin. He's says ya got 48 hours to give it back to him. If ya don't, he wants me to kill ya. Be prepared to pay more than ya took, cause that's the way the boss works these things. Ya been warned.
Guess you want to go in, hunh? Well, I guess you look okay.

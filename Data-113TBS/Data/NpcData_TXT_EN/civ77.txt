You... you're one of THEM!
Help! Rebels!
The rebels are here!
If I had a gun, you'd be dead.
How DARE you?
I hope the army kills you slow and painfully.
Once the army gets here, you're in for a world of pain.
Go to hell.
This is my home. Go away.
Nobody wants you here.
You're nothing bug  a bunch of thugs.
One day, you'll pay for what you did here.
Arulco will prevail!
Long live Queen Deidranna!

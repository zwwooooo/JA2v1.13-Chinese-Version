Ready for training, sir!
So... how do we start?
For the revolution!
If you think I can be a soldier, then I'll give my very best.
I am excited. Excited... and a bit scared.
But you will fight alongside us, right?
Where is the training camp?
Give me a rifle and point me to Meduna!
Is there a salary bonus for nighttime missions?
When I meet the army, it's going to be payback time!
When do I get my blue shirt?
What are your orders?
Reporting for duty, commander!
I hope I won't regret this...
I can't wait to finally shoot back!

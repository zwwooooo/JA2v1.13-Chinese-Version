Cheerio. I don't recall we've met. Well, welcome to ma bar then. It's good to have you here.
Good to see you again, old chap.
Got a few regulars, here, I do. Mostly blokes getting out of the sun. Bloody hot here, I find.
Can't complain about business, but lately, you know, it's uh, it's mostly people coming in to use the loo.
Very kind of you, chap, but eh, I've no use for that.
It's a right good life, if you ask me. Never thought me a bartender, but I fancy it now. Pace is slow, blokes are kind, and every so often a, uh, pretty lady comes in, eh. Right proper, it is.
Maybe I'm wrong, chap, but you'll pardon me if I am, but I reckon, uh, you could use a stiff pint. Feeling a little tense, I gather.
No thanks. I wouldn't know what to do with a gun.
Need a doctor...
I'll leave you be, chap.
I do accept tips, but I'd rather you order first.
Got some choice bottles, eh. What's your fancy?
No hurry, chap. Take your time.
Blimey this heat, eh! Cold drink will do you good.
Sorry, chap. It's cash only. With all the wankers 'round here, I'd have me a bar full of knicknacks by now.
Not in the buying business, friend. Sorry.
Hmm, might be worth something... but not to me.

Nothing personal you understand, but, eh, it's a cash-only bar.



You're covered, chap.
Cheers, and thank you.
Wet your whistle, chap. But let me know when you'd like another.
When you're thirsty, just call.
You might be wanting this.

Bloody buller bastard!
Thanks, chap... Much appreciated.
Bloody big commotion... I will not be tending bar 'til it quiets down.
Sorry, chap, but the locals would stop comin' in if they knew I was serving you.

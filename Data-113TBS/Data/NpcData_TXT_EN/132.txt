Hi. Nurse Jenny, how can I help you?
I thought we'd see you again.
Sometimes, I don't know how these doctors keep up the pace. There's always an emergency coming through the front door.
There's a lot of people in this place pulling for you. But you didn't hear that from me.
Thanks, but hospital policy strictly forbids accepting any gifts.
We're running out of everything. I don't know how much longer this can go on.
There's really no call for that. We're all in this together.
I'm flattered, but I'm needed here, at the hospital.
Aaah...get Doctor Willis...or...or any doctor.
There's a virus going around. I don't have time to chat right now.
Thank you. I can't say I get tipped too often.
Just wait here for a moment while I go see if I can find you a doctor.
Doctor Willis, these soldiers are here wishing to see a doctor.
We have patients, Doctor Beaumont. It's those paramilitary people.
I'm sorry, but the doctors will not be seeing any patients until the hostilities calm.
There was a shady looking man in here claiming to know you. He said if you came by, you could find him in San Mona. He didn't say precisely where.
Some creepy man named Carmen wanted me to tell you he was in Drassen.
I can't accept those supplies. The hospital policy is very clear on that.
Have you lost your mind?
Huhh, finally the bleeding is under control. Sort of ironic, needing medical aid in the middle of the hospital.
It is most unfortunate, but we can't help you. We are the only medical facility in the countryside. And we mustn't lose the trust of the people we serve. Gain their trust, and then we will be able to help you.
From what I hear, you seem to be making headway against the army. It is very good news. It offers us all hope.

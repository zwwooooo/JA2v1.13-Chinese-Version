Alert! Rebels!
The rebels are here for the plane!
Now where did you come from?
Help!
One of them is over here!
Please let me go.
What do you want from me? I move crates, dammit!
I've got no business with you!
This just isn't my day.
I give up!
Am I in trouble?
I'm confused.
What is happening?
Uh-oh.

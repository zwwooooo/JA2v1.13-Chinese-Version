I'm Damon! Kingpin's personal bodyguard. Who the hell are you?
You're back.
Ya, whatever.
That's nice.
I don't want it.
Give it a rest.
Threaten me again, and I'll be the last person you ever threaten!
Already got a job.
Heal me up, so I can kick your ass.
Why don't you go play your little war games somewhere else.
I can't be bought.
Kingpin is expecting you. You'll find him in his gaming room to your right.
Oh, yeah?
Suck on this, sleezeball!
You're not expected, so you're not welcome.

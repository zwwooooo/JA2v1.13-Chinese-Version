Yes...
Good to see you.
I cannot be of more help.
Me, I am guard. It is what I do best.
I do not want it.
I do not know.
Yelling will change nothing. I know nothing...
I stay with Miguel. He must decide.
I bleed... Hurts much.
I do not have time.
Why have you brought them here? Have you lost your mind, woman? You bring death to all of us.
In respect of your husband, I take your word. We will go down. But if you make mistake, Fatima, you will die with them.
I would like this. I can learn much.
Fatima say they are here to help us. She say she have proof, Carlos.
You will pay for your mistake with your life!
You have impressed Miguel. He speaks highly of you.
I like money.

Freedom. Sweet freedom. I'm Greg Duncan. A survivor of Deidranna's madness.
Good to see ya... I haven't forgotten ya. Doubt I ever will.
I might be able to help ya.
Satan himself wouldn't last the day in a cell at Tixa.
Thanks. But I don't need it.
Hard to believe I'm finally free.
You don't scare me. There's nothing left to scare.
I'm thinking I should check in with my wife.
I need to get medi...a doctor.
I ain't got time.
I ain't got nothing to say to you, until you pay me the money you owe me.
I'm sure I can put that to use.
Could be my chance to watch the bitch die. Ya...I got a score to settle.
What do say to fifty bucks a day? Something to send back to the wife and put food in my mouth along the way. I'm pretty good at jimming doors. Could get ya into alot of places.
I've was caged up for over a month. A month longer than most people imprisoned in Tixa. They usually don't make it past the first day!
My crime? I was told to attend one of Queen's speeches and to clap loudly. My kid got sick, and I forgot all about it. They came for me the same night.
When I told the authorities what happened, they shot and killed my four year old son right in front of me, just so it wouldn't happen again.
I know you're busy. Ya got a war to fight and all. I should be grateful just for the chance to breath air, but I'm hurtin' bad and could use some bandaging...
Thanks. Feeling better already.
Only reason I'm probably still alive is that my brother runs the mining operation in Grumm. That was enough to make sure the guards brought me my food first. There was never enough go around.
Grumm might know stuff, etc. A bunch of quest quotes would go either here or in his Tactical quote file.

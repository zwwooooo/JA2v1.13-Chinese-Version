What ya want?
Madame Layla is like a mom to me.
Billy like to sit once in awhile, but I'm not allowed.
My pockets are full.
I don't know nuthin' about the girls. Billy not allowed to touch dem.
You're gonna make me mad, and I'm not allowed to get mad unless Madame Layla tells me to.
Madame Layla says, I have to stand right here and pay attention.
Oh, I got a big boo-boo.
Billy can't talk to you right now.
Madame Layla says I'm not allowed to touch the money.
You're gonna get it!

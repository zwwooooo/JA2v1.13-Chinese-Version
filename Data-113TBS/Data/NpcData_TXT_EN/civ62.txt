What happened?
I don't remember anything.
Damn, I've been hit.
Damn rebels. This day can't get any worse.
Please, I need help.
Do you know where the nearest army base is? I need to get there.
Who are you?
Please tell me you're not one of those rebels.
Those bastards shot me down!
I barely made it out of there.
Hey, do you have a radio or something?
Ow. i'm bleeding.
I need to get out of here.
I think I broke a rib!

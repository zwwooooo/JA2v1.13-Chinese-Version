Remember to stay out of trouble.
Hope you're having good time.
You should pop into one of the bars for a cold one. Do ya good.
There's a lot of ways to spend money in this town. All of them fun.
Remember... Ya step out line, this town can turn real quick.
Town's like an amusement park for big people.
Lighten up, you're on vacation.
Ya should be smiling by now.
Did ya check out the Club. Use to have some good bouts there.
Hope body armor ain't the only protection ya brought.
War or no war...life's always good in San Mona.
San Mona is like Vegas without cops.
Ya stay here long enough, ya forget about your troubles.
I love it here. Got all anyone could want.
Ya look like ya could use a drink.

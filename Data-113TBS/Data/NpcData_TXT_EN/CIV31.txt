We're gonna die, ain't we?
Please stop it.
I'm just a kid. Protect me.
Whaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Help us.
Aren't ya gonna shoot 'em?
When are the bullets gonna stop?
I don't want to die, soldier.
Get them. Fast. I'm scared.
Don't let me die, soldier.
I think I had an accident.
I'm so scared.
I just want the shooting to stop.
I don't want to get hurt.
Make the fighting stop...please.

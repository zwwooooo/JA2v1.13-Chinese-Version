Hey. Who are you?
Stay away from the engines.
We need spare parts.
The old bird is barely holding together.
The next delivery is timed for tomorrow morning, I think.
Ah. Didn't see you there for a moment.
If things go south, I'm taking the next flight out of here.
Man, that Pablo guy is such an ass.
You know Waldo? The guy is a total weirdo.
You remind me of someone. Are you related to Sal?
Watch your step, this is a restricted area.
Can't wait until my shift is over.
Is this another one of those surprise inspections?
Can I help you?
I'm not here to hold your hand, kid.

Thank you for gettin' rid of spiders.
I sleep good. It is because you kill all the bugs.
No more spiders. Thank you.
I no see bugs anymore.
You killed bugs. We are happy.
You number one bug killer.
It is much better without ugly spiders.
We are safe from big insects. Thank you, soldier.
If you no here, the bugs would eat everybody.
I hope I never see those monsters again.
I hate bugs. I happy they all dead.
You scare away monsters.
You're tough. Even monster spiders are scared of you.
Those spiders will not come back with you here.
No more monsters. We're okay now.

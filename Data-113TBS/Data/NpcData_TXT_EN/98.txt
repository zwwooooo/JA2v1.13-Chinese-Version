I'm Pablo Greco. What do you want?
You again.
Ya... It's nice talking to you, but I got a lot of friends. What I never got enough of is spending money.
I never stop, I tell you. Pace around here would bury someone like you.
I already got enough stuff to keep track of.
I really don't care who you are or why you're here.
Relax...
Nah...
It hurts... I fraggin' hurt.
I got a lot of work to do.
Coffee money. Help me keep my eyes open, if you know what I mean.
Well...Whatever you were expecting, isn't here. You can try again tomorrow.
Ya... I got something for you.
A small package came in...just hope I didn't misplace it somewhere...
If I remember right it was a decent size, too...
It's fraggin' heavy, too. Nearly pulled out my back. You movin' down here, or something?
And, ah... In case you're not aware, I'm, ah...we're not responsible for anything that might be missing.
It wasn't me I swear.
You don't scare me. I don't care what you do to me. I don't know nothing about your missing stuff.
Okay...ah... Don't go crazy on me. I'll see what I can do... I'll ask around. But I'll need time, maybe you can come back tomorrow.
I have good news for you. It wasn't easy, but I managed to find your missing stuff. Even threw in a couple of extra things I found lying around just to make up for the inconvenience.
A lot of people come in and out of here, you know. I can't be babysitting your shipments. Well... At least not for free.

You come here often?
What's up?
I've got to get a satellite dish so I can pull in the all-girl channel.
You don't want to buy any of the products in this place. I've gotten some really bad rashes.
What do ya want me to do with that?
You like my earrings? I got twelve of them. And I still got an ear left to fill.
Take a pill, soldier boy!
You gotta be kidding! I don't like guns. They're just phallic symbols for you coward macho types.
I'm in pain... serious pain... but there's a hint of pleasure to it.
Don't you got somewhere else to be?
I won't do nuthin' for it. That, you can be sure of.
You never have nuthin' Hans! Your For Woman By Woman section is next to empty. You got the same three films...all starring Twin Peakes. She's been dead for more than five years, Hans!
What about ordering some new stuff, huh... Like Titanik, or Bad Jill Humping, or As Sore as it Gets...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're just lucky you're the only Adult store in this backwoods country.
Woah! PANTSUIT LORETTA 6: THE MEN ARE AWAY. I haven't seen this one. Thanks!
Well, that's it, Hans. I'm tired of your poor selection. I'm leaving, and I'm not coming back until you get some new stock.
Get out of here!
If I had a gun, you'd be dead, you weeny bastard!
Wanna wait until it calms down around here?

HELP!!!
Help! It's the rebels!
The rebels are here!
Enemy! Quick, lock the console!
Code zulu, wipe the control system!
I surrender!
Oh no! Rebels!
This isn't good.
Now don't do anything we' both regret.
Hey. Listen, uhm... I'm a lot more useful to you alive than dead.
Have you heard of the Geneva convention?
Yeah... you got me.

Mary Kulba from Cleveland, Ohio. It's nice to make your acquaintance.
Remember me? Mary Kulba from Cleveland, Ohio.
I never thought I'd find myself in the middle of a war.
John's terrible when it comes to organizing vacations. I spent my honeymoon in Paris... Texas.
Sure... Thanks a lot, now.
I wanted to go to Disneyland in Orlando. It was John who insisted on going to Aruba. All because his brother went, and won't stop going on about it.
I'll do whatever you say.
Oh, John would never allow me to join.
Oh, my gosh... I'm bleeding John... John?
It was nice meeting you. I hope everything works out.
Oh, no, you keep it. You can pick up all kinds of stuff at the Mary Lynn factory in Drassen. With the exchange rate, they're practically giving the stuff away.
Well... that's not quite true, John. Paula told us to check the tickets and make sure everything was okay. You checked them, John. I specifically remember you checking them.
John was crazy for trusting you.
I don't see the airport.
The sooner I see the airport the better.
My husband has no appreciation for history.
I have very mixed feelings about it. At least I'll see my grandchildren again, but they'll miss John. So will I. Oh, thank you nonetheless.
This is all the vacation money we have. But, I don't mind giving it to you in the least. Just to be safely out of this country and back into the arms of my children and grandchildren, oh it's worth every dime.
I just want to be in Cleveland. My mind is already there.
My husband is in pain.
Oh my God, John... John...
Oh, no... Oh, no...
Oh my! How can you even think about talking right now?
Finally. I thought you were going to leave me here forever.

I don't talk to strangers.
I'm gonna be in army, too, someday.
Daddy said to pretend you're not there.
I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Are you gonna save us?
I can't find my friend anywhere.
I want my mommy.
I don't like the fighting.
I bet you've killed people.
I hate Arulco.
Don't hurt me. I just want to play.
This place sucks.
I want a candy.
Daddy says everything is gonna be okay.
You look mean.

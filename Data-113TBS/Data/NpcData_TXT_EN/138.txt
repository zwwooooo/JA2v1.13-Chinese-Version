Yup...
Feels like rain.
Ah-huh...
Nah...
Sure like to work on a jet engine one day.
I'm not scared of nuthin' no more.
Nah... Don't think I want to be doing that.
Yup... It don't look good for me.
Wish I could talk more. Can't.
I'm gonna take it, 'cause I haven't got paid in some time.
Yup. That helicopter works all right, but you killed the pilot. Course, there was another fella. Can't remember his name.
Saw him around here, oh, not a week ago, wearing big wader boots. He kinda smelt like a swamp, too.
Think he's in some kinda trouble with the Army... He was sneaking around, making sure nobody saw him. He's probably one of them draft dodger fellas.
Bet the Army could really use another pilot, too. You kinda created an immediate openin'.
What's the matter with you?
It's too dangerous to talk now.
Why, thank you.
Yup. Kinda think I can fix the helicopter. She's damaged pretty good though. Take some time... And parts. Plenty of parts. Come back tomorrow.
Lost the helicopter, huh. Too bad. If it was in Drassen, I might have been able to do something for ya. I'd have access to my tools and some parts.
Keep your money. Can't do nothing for ya.
You ARE gonna get the job done, huh? The whole thing. Don't want ya just gettin' her mad...

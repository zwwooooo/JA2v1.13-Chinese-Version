My father told me you were gonna make things better.
I'm happy you here. I don't like Queen.
If I was bigger, I would fight for you.
My mother said one you would come.
My daddy says you will make us free.
I glad to see you.
You are friend.
You save us.
You will protect everybody, right?
You are very strong soldier.
My uncle wants you to kill the Queen.
Did you see my mommy?
Is it okay to play now?
It is nice you help us.
You are the best.

You bring us nothing but trouble.
Deidranna will make us all pay dearly for your foolishness.
We'll never be safe with you in our town.
Don't make yourself too comfortable.
Why don't you leave us alone?
The Arulcan Army will be back.
You are not wanted here.
We do not want your help.
Leave quickly. Your aid is not needed.
You have turned our town into a place of war.
You are not welcome in our town.
I don't trust you.
You will get us all killed.
Go save someone else. Arulco doesn't need saving.
The Queen will get her revenge.

Yeah, this is Arulco's secondary commercial airstrip. She's ferrying stuff in and out of here all the time. She's got one of her goons to keep an eye on it, too. Man, I'd love to take him out.
Well, you'll find a nice bombed out piece of tarmack here that used to pass for the local airstrip. Believe it or not, there was a time when people used it for pleasure, before the Queen bombed it, that is.
Now this is an oddity. Drassen actually has a church here. Why the Queen lets it continue is anybody's guess, but I'd bet my bottom dollar that something's up. Father Walker says she fears crossing the Pope.
There's a Military Base here. It's where the bitch trains her troops. She brainwashes them, then supplies them their only opportunity for pride: a uniform and us rebels as a target.
The Queen keeps a bunch of stuff in a warehouse here. I'm not exactly certain what, I mean, I've never been inside, but I presume it's things that they use in their training. Bunch of pigs.
I keep expecting Amnesty International to raid this place. See, she's got her Military Prison here. Mostly confines army personnel who ask too many questions or don't do as they're told.
And I'll tell you another thing, too. I've seen a lot of people go in there, and they don't come out. They don't go anywhere! They just disappear - no bones, no bodies, no nothing.
It's a sorry town. The people are living on the edge of all her military crap, and they pretty much work in the mines day in and day out. Problem is, she's got Goons here watching. They don't have a choice.
They got a hospital here in Cambria. You ask me, it's pretty much a free-range virus farm, but beggars can't be choosers now, can they?
There's a university here that's as empty as the bitch's head. Queen shut it down years ago. She doesn't need anyone getting smart. She needs miners and soldiers. Money and Power!
You'll notice that the homes here are better than most. You know why? 'Cause flippin' doctors always make more money than everyone else, that's why! Happens everywhere. Just here, even they're poor.
Got a few shops in Cambria. It's like the hub of the countryside. The people here have to be careful. The Queen's got a Goon here who's got his beady little eyes into everything. I'd hurt him.
This is probably the only part of San Mona you can show on postcards, well except for the fire that trashed the view up north. Everything here's pretty much on the up and up.
You got your hookers, your bars, you name it here! It's almost like the Las Vegas of Arulco, except it's all owned by one man.
There's this guy here, name's Kingpin... you can tell he thinks he's a big shot, huh? Well, he owns everything and he runs his exclusive club. Gotta be a MEMBER or a friend to get in. Well, screw him. I don't need it.
Yeah, there's a bunch of huts here for the miners. Man, I tell you, if I were them, I'd say something! They just schlep to the mines every day for the Queen. Even if she does have one of her Goons here, I'd say something!
Got some Ruins here in Chitzena. Box of rocks used to be a tourist attraction. Brought in all kinds of dough for Arulco over a decade ago. I was never much for history. Majored in humanities.
Got good and bad here along the coast. Decent housing, but the Queen's factory is spewing all kinds of pollution all over the place! Town of Grumm's pretty industrial.
Got some shops here in Grumm, but they tend to keep quiet. Guess they figure what the Queen doesn't know, the Queen won't disturb. Of course, that's stupid if you ask me. She knows everything.
We need to be careful here. She's got a factory here with this glowing, green stuff. In my opinion, no one in Grumm is gonna live past the age of 25... and those are the non-smokers.
Now that we're here, you can get used to the taste of barbeque pit in your mouth. They burn plenty of coal around here. There's a bar nearby, so we can get something to wash the taste out.
I used to come around here to get gas, pick up parts for the car in the junkyard. That was when you saw cars in Arulco. Gas is next to impossible to come by. The Queen only imports enough for her purposes.
Queen's got a nature center here, but I don't know if I'm buying it. Got lots of body parts coming and going, but on the other hand, they ARE studying Bloodcats... so maybe they're just not careful. Hard to say.
Here we are in beautiful Balime, home of the rich and manipulative. So what if I'm bitter! I don't care. I'm about to get even.
They got a museum here that smells of an assbackwards Robin Hood. Queen stole every artifact and article of value from the poor and put it on display for the rich.
I made up a little rhyme about the gardens here. It goes something like this: Queen, Queen, I'd take out your spleen, but how does your garden grow? With Silver Bells and mortar shells, and your soldiers all in a row.
This is where her palace is. Oh, I've been waiting for this! If it were me, I'd just rush right in and shoot her. Twice!
I've known this was here for a while. Never seen it right up close. It's a surface-to-air missile site. Obviously, this isn't the place of the friendly skies.
Please make certain your seats are in their upright position, 'cause from here on out, it's gonna be turbulent. She guards this airport here with all kinds of sadistic crap. We gotta be careful.
Just homes here. Oh, and machine guns, and probably tanks. A regular day for the citizens of Meduna. You ask me, I'd be right the hell out of here.
Ain't so bad in this part of Meduna, but it's bad enough. Think we can expect some serious defenses. We're ready for them, huh? Got a few homes and stores here, too.
They got a jail here that makes Alcatraz look like Disneyland. It's not just the jail's condition either. The warden's got a house right on the grounds, and by all accounts, she's one mean bitch.
Prepare to meet resistance! The Queen has one of her SAM sites located here.
Expect trouble! There's a SAM installation close by. I love it when we capture those. I'm tired of that bitch ruling the skies.
There another missile site here, so you know it's gonna be well-guarded. Not that I care much... I've been waiting to settle the score for so long, the more the merrier, I say.

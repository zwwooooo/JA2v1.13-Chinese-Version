You have to do something. Those gruesome bugs are eating us alive.
Those beasts are everywhere!
The insects are eating people! I've seen it.
Those god-awful bugs are everywhere.
Can't you do something about those insects?
I heard those creatures ate someone else last night.
You have to help us. The spiders are terrorizing us.
I saw one... It was disgusting.
If you really cared about us, you'd do something about those beasts.
The town barely sleeps. The threat of a attack from those creatures terrifies us.
I've heard the bugs are as big as we are... It can't be true.
Is it true? Do giant bugs kill people at night?
Between you and me, I find this whole creature thing hard to swallow.
You are the only ones capable of stopping the giant spiders, you must do something.
First the queen, and now the bugs. Haven't we suffered enough?

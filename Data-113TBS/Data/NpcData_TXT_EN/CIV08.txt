We are all behind you. Godspeed!
Everyone in town is pulling for ya.
Got my fingers crossed so tight they hurt. Good luck.
Things sure are starting to look better.
Don't even give her the chance to beg for her life.
This town is your town. We ain't never living under her again.
Death to the Queen.
You're gonna save us. I know it.
Way to go.
Don't stop now. We're with ya.
Ya got the whole town a buzz. The smart money's on you.
Slit her throat slowly...in public. I've been living to see it.
Got a lot of confidence in you. Whole town does.
We were never for her, ya know. Just scared.
Just want ya to know, we sure like having you around.

There is talk of a hidden city. I do not know its name or even if it has one. It is said that weapons, very powerful weapons, are made there.
It makes me sad to see our country like this. To think once tourists came from all over to visit the ruins in Chitzena. It seems like a long time ago.
Are we safe from the missile site just south of here? They have many powerful weapons!

Guns make me nervous.
Bet you're glad you don't live here.
Will there ever be an end?
This country has been in the toilet since Enrico Chivaldori was murdered.
Nobody deserves to live like this.
Maybe... Things will change.
Arulco will see better days.
Enrico's death brought death to us all.
Do not underestimate the Queen.
If only I could leave Arulco...
You cannot imagine what we've seen.
She is Satan. I risk my life to say this.
I beg you... you must finish what you have started.
The sun still shines in Arulco. She cannot take this away.
It is hopeless.

You've saved us! The country! Its people! Arulco is free at last!
The pleasure is mine...
We believed the rebels when they said you were coming. We hoped. We prayed, and those prayers have been answered.
May she rot in hell. You have given us our freedom back, and for that, we can never repay your bravery.
Oh, no. You may need it.
You will be remembered in the history of Arulco.
The time for anger has passed, friend! We shall celebrate in your name!
I am honored, but you don't need me.
I... I need a doctor.
I don't want to take up all of your time.
Your kindness is amazing.
I... I don't understand? Me? Why? Was it... accident? Maybe?
Wait until the fighting stops...
Then she is dead! It's really true! Arulco is free from Deidranna!
Everyone, remember this moment! The day of our freedom! And these, these are the heroes we will speak of for years to come. Thank you!
No... If I had any money, I would gladly pay you!
Slay the creatures! Kill them! Then Arulco will be truly free.

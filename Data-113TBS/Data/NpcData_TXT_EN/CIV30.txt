Do something. It's very dangerous.
All of us will die!
Kill them before they kill us.
Be careful. And watch where you shoot.
You must stop this. We are all in danger.
Protect the innocent. Please.
Stop the shooting!
Our town is a battlefield.
Be done with them quickly, before more civilians die.
We are caught in the middle. Do something!
You must take control of the situation.
This country is crazy.
Bullets! Everywhere bullets.
Can't something be done? We are in the middle of a war.
Get away. You are a target.

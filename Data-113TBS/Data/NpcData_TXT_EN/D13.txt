If you think Drassen has problems, you have not been to San Mona. It is a lawless town run by a man called Kingpin.
Psssst. There is a man, Tony, he deals in guns. You will find him in San Mona. He operates out of the back of one of the shops. I hope this helps.
I hope you will not need to know this, but if ever your soldiers need medicine, there is a hospital in Cambria. You can trust the doctors there.
You will want to avoid Alma. It is a military town with many soldiers.
I think all of us should be standing up to the Queen's army. Maybe you show us how to use guns?
Did you happen to notice if Father Walker was in the bar north of here?
Do you also hideout in the swamp house northeast of here?
Do you stay in that swamp house northeast of here?
Do you come from that swamp house southeast of here?
Is your hideout that house in the swamp just west of here?

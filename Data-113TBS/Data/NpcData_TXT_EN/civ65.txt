Wait a minute! You're not the administrator!
This is a waste of my time!
Begone, peasant!
I surrender!
Oh no. You're one of them...
HELP!!!
This is uncomfortable.
Ehm... hi?
*cough*
Please, I am unarmed!
This day keeps getting better and better.
I knew i should have gone to Vancouver instead.
I'm not military, I just code!
Don't mind me. I'll see myself out.

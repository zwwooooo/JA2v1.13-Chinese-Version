I'm Doreen Harrows, the factory manager.
What do you want this time?
This isn't going anywhere.
You are only wasting time. Mine included.
I don't want any of your gifts.
You should just go back to wherever you came from.
Okay... I'd like to help you, but I only know about making baseball caps and sweatshirts.
I care nothing about you, or this country.
Ohhh...the pain. The pain is unbearable!
I really don't have time for this.
I hope you're not expecting me to do anything for it... because I won't.
This is a private company, you have no business being here. You'll find nothing that concerns you, or your war. We make baseball caps and sweatshirts for a celebrity-endorsed clothing line.
I understand your concern about the age of the workers. I, too, was fooled the first time I saw them. They are all a lot older than they look.
It's the exceptional working conditions. Keeps them looking youthful.
They should be in school? They are in school... This is the school.
Look! I've had enough of this. I have a business to run. And I'll run it any damn way I choose. You don't like it, too bad.
You're right! You are absolutely right... They're kids. I'll shut the factory down. I never liked this job anyway.
Mary Lynn will have to get her clothing line manufactured somewhere else. I never liked that woman either. Thought she was really something cause she had her own TV show.
I've seen the light. I don't know what I was thinking before, but you straightened me out, and I'm grateful for it.
You idiot!
Get away from me. I don't want your help.
The Queen will deal with you soon enough. Her word will be final, so enjoy life while you can.
Not now... You're a walking target, in case you hadn't noticed.

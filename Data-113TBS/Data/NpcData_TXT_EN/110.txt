Yo.
Still alive, ay?
I come down for a vacation. So's I get a war! Da luck I got, you know? Itza bad.
Told the old lady, I says, I'm going for a little trip, and she gets all hot under da collar! Now it's me who's hot. Itza no place for a family man, you know what I'm saying? The family. It's important.
No, forget about it.
You know, I figured there'd be more broads down here. What's a vacation without broads? I mean, who's doing my cookin' and cleanin', you know what I mean?
Just back off. You got a problem with that? Just forget about it. You sound like my old lady.
Hey, you couldn't afford me, you know what I'm saying? And, ah, I'm not into it anyway. Just forget about it.
Uh, yo, get me a doctor.
I got better things to do.
Hey, I owe you, you know what I'm saying? And I got connections. Wait, just forget about that.
Yous don't know who yous messin' with!
Betta not be any strings attached ta dis!
What were you thinkin'! Now it's your turn to get whacked!
Hey, yo. You settle dis little turf war before you be talking ta me.

This is none of your business.
I have no business with you.
Come between us and our prey, and you will regret it.
Hey! We got here first!
Great. You're an amateur.
Just a quick heads-up: We are going to cash in, and you can do nothing about it.
Where are the damn targets?
Who the hell are you?
Do I know you?
Back off, you wuss!
You still here?
Didn't I tell you to get lost?
The bounty will be ours, you'll see.
You should leave. You're not made for this.

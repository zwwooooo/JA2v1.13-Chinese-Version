I more prepared for war now.
The more I train or fight the more confident I feel.
Nerves are steady now.
I am not as scared as I used to be.
I think I am ready for whatever happens.
I will try and make you proud.
I am becoming comfortable with my abilities.
There was a time when I doubted myself.
I believe I can do this. I feel ready to defend us.
I am not professional soldier, but I am prepared.
I will not embarrass myself or anyone.
I feel ready.
I have gotten better at fighting. I think.
I lack only experience to be the best that I can be.
Now I have methods to defend my wife and family.

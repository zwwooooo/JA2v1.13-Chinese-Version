Got something to say before you die?
You're tempting fate.
Point is -  I'm too good to work with others. Was part of AIM for a long time.
I got the call, the cash was good, real good, so I took the job. I don't care which side I work for.
Trust me, I've got everything I need.
Look, I don't have to justify anything to you or to anyone else. I go where the cash is.
Have you lost your mind?
You're a little late for that. I'm already on the payroll.
Need a medic here.
Just back away. I'll give you a head start before I shoot you.
Just like old times. Not that it changes anything.
Target in sight.
YOU'RE the target, and I don't miss.
That wouldn't buy a minute of my time.
Aw, don't look so surprised. It's never been about glory for me. It's about money.

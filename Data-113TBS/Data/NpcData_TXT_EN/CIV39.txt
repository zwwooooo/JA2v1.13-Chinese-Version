You da best!
I hope she screamed. I hope she screamed very loud.
You gonna kill the ant bugs now?
You are sure Deidranna is dead?
It is very good day for my country.
I wish I could have seen her die.
Now, you must do something about those bugs.
I beg you, kill those beasts like you killed Deidranna.
Thank you, thank you!
You will be remembered always. Good luck with the insects that cause terror.

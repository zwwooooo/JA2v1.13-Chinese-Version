I heard the army killed another dozen of those traitors last night.
I hope the queen doesn't go easy on the rebels.
Have you heard? The rebels are paid from the outside.
Why does the world hate us so?
What did we ever do to deserve this?
Uh... What is going on?
All hail Deidranna!
Long live the queen!
What do those peasants complain about? Life in Arulco is great.
Did you know Miguel Cordona makes his money in human trafficking?
I hate the rebels.
I hate mercenaries.
Go away.
I sooo don't need this today.

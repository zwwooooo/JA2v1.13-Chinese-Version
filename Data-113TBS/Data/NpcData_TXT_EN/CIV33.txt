Miss Doreen is a terrible woman.
Please free us from this bad woman.
I hate being here.
You must help us. We are beaten here.
Help us! I want to go home.
Miss Doreen is evil.
We should be in a real school.
I hate making clothing.
My hands hurt very much.
Please tell her to let us go home.
Miss Doreen is friend of the Queen.
We only go home late at night. We work all day long. If we don't, Miss Doreen will beat us.
Why do we have to make these stupid caps?
You should be careful of Miss Doreen.
Please let us go home.

Hello there.
Dinnae think I'd see ya again.
Cannae say I'm in love with this place.
Ye should just take out the whole bleedin' country. Just be lettin' me know first.
Now what would I want with that, then.
If it's anything to ya, I'm doing a research study for Scotland Yard.
Yer pushin' it.
No thanks. I've got to complete ma study here.
Need... a physician.
I got lots to be thinking about, so I'll cut you loose.
Kind of ya.
Ya fixed yerself fine this time!
Course I'll take it! Won't do nothing for it.
First, it's gonna be you. Then your buddies, and then your whole damn family! They dinnae call me Mayhem for nothing!
Think there be other problems here ya better contend with first, before we be talking.

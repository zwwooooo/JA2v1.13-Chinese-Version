You have no idea how thankful we are. I am so honored to meet you!
Remember me?
Freedom! It is not something I believed I would see in my lifetime!
The Queen is dead at last! You may not believe this, but all of us wanted her dead! We feared her too much to rise against her. I hope you understand.
No, I could not possibly accept anything from you. It is me who should be giving YOU gifts!
Me? You want to talk to me? I don't know what to say! I am so grateful for everything you have done!
Oh, I understand. It is a great victory you have achieved today! Some time to relax, to understand, all that you have accomplished is what you need.
It's not for me.
Would you...help me?
You are heroes, and I am happy for this brief moment with you...
I shall never forget your kindness.
Wha... what? I... I don't understand!
You have more pressing matters...
There... There they are! Everyone! It's them!
Queen Deidranna! Never, never again! We never trusted her! Never liked her! Did we, huh! Did we! Better off dead and buried! Yeah!
And generous, too! Thank you!
And the creatures! You won't leave us alone with those... those disgusting things, will you? They'll kill us all!
Yah! Then your job will be over!

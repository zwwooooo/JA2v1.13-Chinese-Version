Thank you for saving us.
Now... I can go home and be with my family.
I am scared no more. You have saved us.
I make clothing no more!
We are free!
We no longer have to work here!
My mother is going to be very happy.
We can go home!
I wish I was old enough to kill her myself.
We work here no more.
Thank you for freeing us.
I can help my parents now!
I can't wait to tell my father!
I hated Doreen!
We can go play!

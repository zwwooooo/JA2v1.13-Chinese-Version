My family is starving.
I am starving.
My life is a shambles.
I have very little means to survive.
I used to work for a living, now I beg.
I'm poor.
I need money for food.
Do you have any food to spare?
I'm sorry... but I'm hungry.
I must eat soon.
I hope you can change this country. I don't want to be a beggar forever.
I need to buy medicine for my daughter.
I wish I was healthy like you.
Please don't hurt me - I'm only a beggar.
I am so tired of begging for food.

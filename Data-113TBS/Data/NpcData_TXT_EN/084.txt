You..you don't look like a doctor.
I saw another... another one... I'm sure of it.
They're big... Big and ugly...
I..I don't...don't...know how I... I got away.
Get that...that away from me.
They smell...smell terrible.
It tried...tr-tried...tried to eat me.
I'm staying...staying right here.
It...It...hurts.
I don't feel...feel up to talking.
All...right....
I was just looking...looking for gold dust in the mines. And...and I saw a hole that...that went down...down below the mines. I saw it...it attacked me fa...fa...fast.
It was spitting...spitting...spitting and grabbing. It was scary... terrible. I don't know...know what happened after that.
If...I could...I'd kill you.

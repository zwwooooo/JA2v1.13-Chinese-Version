You can't be worse than anything we're used to.
I never thought I'd see you here. Not in my town.
Be fair to us, and we'll be fair to you.
I hope the whole country will be liberated someday.
You offer hope.
The town welcomes your presence.
You are a hero. May the Gods guide you to victory.
We pray this is a start to a better tomorrow.
The town rejoices in your victory.
Things can only get better for us now.
We have waited for this day most of our lives.
You are our saviors.
I do not know who sent you, but I thank them.
It is a great day for our town.
It is hard to believe. You are like a gift.

You have taken care of the beasts. We are all grateful.
No sign of the creatures. I am more relaxed now.
Looks like ya squashed the bugs. People calling ya the exterminator.
Looks like those creatures are gone.
I no see bugs no more.
I think we are safe from the evil creatures now.
Ya musta killed all the insects. They no longer terrorize us.
The town is free of bugs. I think.
The nights are peaceful now. The creatures are gone.
We are grateful that you have killed the beasts.
The beasts no longer show themselves. Perhaps, they are all dead?
Even the beasts are no match for you.
The creatures have disappeared.
No more insects. We are happy for this.
The big insects are gone. We pray they do not come back.

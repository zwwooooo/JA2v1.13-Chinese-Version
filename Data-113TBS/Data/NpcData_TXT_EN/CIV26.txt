My death shall curse you.
My friends will deal with you.
I am just one of many.
Enjoy it now! But I will wait for you in Hell.
Kill me. Or do you lack the guts.
It was luck.
Your time will come, too.
I do not fear you or death.
God will judge you for this.
Others will take care of you.
Kill me, so I don't have to look at your ugly face anymore.
We will meet again. You can be sure.
You coward.
You will be next.
If I could spit, it would hit your face.

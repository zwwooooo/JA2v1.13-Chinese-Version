Don't think you're gonna find anyone hidin' out down here.
Feel free to look around, ain't nobody gonna bother you.
Only us miners down here.
It's dark and cold, but at least there's no fighting.
We don't get too many visitors in the hole.
About all you'll find here is a couple of pieces of ore lying around.
Don't be touchin' a shovel. This here's union work.
Don't think there's anything down here that you're looking for.
Ain't no soldiers down here. Just us miners.
You can relax. There's nobody in the mine looking for any trouble.
You should probably talk to the head miner up top. Maybe you can convince him to help you..
Why don't you go see the head miner on the surface? I'm sure  we'd all be willing to help you out, but he's the guy to decide.
Maybe we can be working for YOU. Speak with the head miner back on the surface and see if you can convince him.
Have you spoken to Matt, the head miner yet? He's up top running things. Maybe you can convince him to help you.
There is so much gold in here - maybe we can help you. Talk to the head miner on the surface and see what happens.

It will be a long war, but we have learned to be patient.
You mustn't tell anyone of this hideout.
We fight together for freedom.
We will not be defeated.
This place is not comfortable, but it has kept us alive.
I hope together we can defeat Queen Deidranna.
Queen Deidranna's army is looking for us.
Most of our homes have been destroyed.
Even though we hide now, soon we will emerge to fight for our liberty.
You must not be seen coming here or you will give us away.
I hope we can have our revenge on Deidranna.
You must listen to Miguel.
Most of us have lost loved ones.
We have faith that Miguel will lead us to victory.
Queen Deidranna thinks she has beaten us.

This day can't possibly get any worse.
Why?
I didn't do anything!
What did I ever do to you?
Help!
I was just doing my job!
No! Please!
I am unarmed!
I'm not a soldier, I just work here!
I surrender! I surrender!
Please don't hurt me.
I'll do anything you ask, just... let me go.
You don't want to do this.
Hey... don't do anything we'd both regret, okay?

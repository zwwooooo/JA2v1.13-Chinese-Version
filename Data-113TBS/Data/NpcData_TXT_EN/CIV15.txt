I don't like you. You left us here with them.
Why did you go? Don't you care about us...
I hope you killed the man who hurt my mommy.
Please don't leave this time.
I knew you'd come back.
Are ya gonna stay this time?
I happy to see you again.
I was really scared when the army was here.
The army is mean. Please don't let them come back.
Where did ya go?
Don't leave us again. Please...
I prayed you come back and save us.
It was terrible. Don't ever go away again.
My parents are very happy to see you back.
I know you no forget us.

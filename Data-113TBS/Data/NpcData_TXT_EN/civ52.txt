I will tell you nothing.
You got lucky this time.
It wasn't me, officer! This is a mix-up!
You'll see, soon the tables will be turned.
I have nothing to say to you.
What will you do to us?
Have mercy!
I was just following orders.
I'll reward you if you release me. But don't tell the others.
Psst, I have secret information to trade.
I did my job, as do you.
You know... I'd be a real asset to your movement.
I will never yield, rebel scum!
How did I end up here.
There are human rights, you know that?

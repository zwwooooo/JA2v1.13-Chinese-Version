Yes.
A returning customer...
The demand for firearms is growing quickly.
Weapons. They are a good business to be in right now.
I do not want that.
I have nothing really to say to you.
Keep it down. The walls are like cardboard.
That will not happen. I am very comfortable here in my business.
A doctor... A doctor soon.
I am terribly sorry. I do not have any more time.
Maybe you should show me what you want to buy...
Point out what it is you are interested in.
The selection this time of year is excellent.
It is okay. Take your time.
You wish to consider a trade, right?
You are interested in selling, is this correct?
Hmm. Let me see what we have here...
I regret I am only interested in weapons and their accessories.
Worthless...
It is third market, second market at best. There is only so much I can do.
There is value to this. I will pay a fair price.
Unfortunately, it's not enough to buy the things you wanted.
The deal is done. Anything else?
All right, there's your purchase and your change.
Very good. You know where to find me if you are interested in doing more business.
Perhaps, next time things will be different.
Excuse me. You are forgetting your stuff.
No, I cannot afford to buy anything else at the moment.
You, are a dead bastard!

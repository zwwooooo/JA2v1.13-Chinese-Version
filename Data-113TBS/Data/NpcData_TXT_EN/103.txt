Gordon... Gordon Jefferies... I know nothin'...
I know nothing... I didn't do it...
Who are you? Why are you toying with me?
Why? Why are you doing this?
What's that? I want nuthin' from you...
No more torture... No more pain... please...
I beg you. Shoot me. Do not feed me to the monsters... I beg you. Shoot me.
Leave me. Leave me to die... Die in peace.
Ahhhhhh... Why must I die so slow?
Go away... Please...just go away.
Do not harm me... I know nothing... I am weak...
Don't touch me... Don't touch me anymore.
Sh... sh... they will... hear you...
For what? Just... just go away.

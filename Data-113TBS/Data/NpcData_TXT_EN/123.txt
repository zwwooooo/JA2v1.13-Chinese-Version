Oh, God. Who left the cage open at the zoo?
And I even get the pleasure of repeat visits.
I hate this place. I mean really, you can't even get a good tan here.
Armand's such a fool. He says the place has "culture," but have you seen so much as one Gucci bag? No. None! I want civilization and I want it now!
Please. Where'd you get that? K-Mart?
Just look at my nails. I've already missed three appointments. I mean, this is a complete travesty, and I won't stand for it anymore.
Obviously, you don't know who you're talking to. I'm Lora Ricci.  Bow, kiss my hand, or worship me from afar, but for Godsake's, don't yell at me!
Please, I wouldn't be seen with you, much less work for my money.
Oh! God! I'm hurt!
Well, this is more fun than I can stand.
Oh, I feel better now. Thank you. I'll get Armand to write you a check.
You've pissed me off!
Now we're talking!
Stop the fighting first! I'm not taking a bullet for you.

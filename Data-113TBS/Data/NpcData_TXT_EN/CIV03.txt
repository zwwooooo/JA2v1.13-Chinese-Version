The spiders are gonna get me!
Ya gotta help us. I'm really scared of those bugs.
They're scary. Real scary... Those big spiders are bigger than me.
A big spider ate my mommy.
I have bad dreams of bad bugs.
Are ya gonna kill the spiders?
I'm scared. Ya gotta do something about those things, soldier.
My dad says there are no such thing as monsters.
Don't let them eat us...please.
The bugs ate my auntie. And she was real big.
I don't want to die. Ya gotta do something.
I hear the bugs have really big teeth.
Are you gonna kill...kill them bugs for us?
The spiders make me stay awake.
They're big! Real Big!

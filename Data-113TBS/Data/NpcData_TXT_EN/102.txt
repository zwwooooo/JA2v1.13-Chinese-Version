I am the warden.
You're still alive...
Don't even try to sweet talk me!
You're wasting your breath. Just do whatever it is you're going to do.
You know what you can do with that!
Say what you will, the Queen will deal with you.
I don't fear you.
Join you? You'll all be dead by the end of the week.
Have... the decency.. to put me... out of my misery.
I have nothing to say.
You're making a huge mistake!
You trying to bribe me? I will confiscate this money as evidence.

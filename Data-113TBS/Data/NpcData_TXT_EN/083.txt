Hi there.
Out and about again, eh?
Hardware store's got duty-free kitchen utensils. There's something good about this place anyway.
Nosy assholes here. Guy says, "So, you're American?" and I says, "No, Scottish. Raised in Canada. I lost my accent, eh?" Like it's his business.
I got no use for it.
People been leaving left and right. I kinda like it. Gives the place more room.
Look, I haven't got any problem with you.
I'm Canadian. We're just peacekeepers, eh?
I... need... a... doctor.
Well, it's been real, eh?
Thanks, eh? Feeling better, eh.
Number's up, sucker.
Thanks, eh? I was running a little low.
I'm gonna chop you up in little pieces, man!
I don't want to be a target, eh? You quiet things down first.

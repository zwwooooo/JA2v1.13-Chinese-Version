I wondered if you'd be back.
The town paid dearly. Hope you're going to protect us this time.
Well... At least you didn't forget about us.
You have returned.
The army was not happy with us. You must not let them in here again.
The army took its revenge. Please do not desert us.
Finally, you have come back to save us.
You must defend the town better.
We can not go through that again. The army was extremely harsh during your absence.
Please... I beg you. Don't let the Arulcan army return.
It was Hell. I do not wish to live through that again.
We prayed you would not forget us.
We were at their mercy.
People will be more cautious of you now. The Queen has made sure of this.
We trusted you. It will take time to trust you again.

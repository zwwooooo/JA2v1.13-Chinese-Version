Hi. You must be from that new PMC they all talk about, right?
You know, i'm the one doing the real work. The others are just dead weight.
I think I saw something on the radar.
This equipment is soo old.
We could really use one of those new guidance systems.
Man, this post sucks. There's never any action.
Why am I the only one without a gun?
You're new. Haven't seen you before.
Who are you?
Are you from the relief patrol?
The guys said something about a missing patrol.
I hope the rebels don't come here.
Man, I need to get out of this hole.
Who goes there?

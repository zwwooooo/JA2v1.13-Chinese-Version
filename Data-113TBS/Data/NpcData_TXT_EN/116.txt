I got dibs, that's all I'm saying.
You come 'round again, huh?
It's just like fishing. Ya never know what yer gonna find in the junkyard. Some days, you come up empty. Other times, I get me a prize.
One time, in the trunk of a Caddy, I found a bunch of old nuddie photos. Heh-heh. Sold 'em to some Mexican driving an ice cream truck.
Ah, no. Ain't gonna be able to find room for that.
Don't tell anyone this, but I'm figuring when this war lifts, well, I'll get me enough junk so's I can start my own yard.
Rat got your ass er something?
My prime has come and passed, I'm afraid.
Lord, my time is comin'...
Well, I ain't getting any younger...
Oh, that's so kind of ya.
You rat's ass!
Awful kind of ya.
Place is a shootin' gallery. No time to talk now.
Why... thank you. Here, I got something for you, too. Don't quite know exactly what it is, but maybe you can find some use for it.
Only kidding, of course. You aren't going to find anything around here that I haven't already seen. Spend my days sifting through this dump.
I have to keep laughing. Try to keep a smile on my face. No point in dwellin' over one's situation. I eat what I find, find what I eat. It wasn't always like that, but well, what can I do?
Army burned down my home four years ago. Everything I had was in it, including my family. They took my whole life from me in less than five minutes.
Got no purpose now. Just wandering around trying to survive and wondering why I bother.
Now, if that Deidranna were to get what's coming to her, then that would be worth staying alive for.
Good luck to ya. You're pretty darn close to finishing the job you come to do. And when you finally do meet her, I want you to put one right between the Queen's eyes, for me.
Why not? I used to panhandle before I got into junkin'.

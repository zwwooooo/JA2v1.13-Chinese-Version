My name is Maddog. I heard about you.
Hmm. I'm surprised. Nobody ever comes back.
The Queen is a moron. She needs to die.
My dad put me in charge of wrecking stuff. That's my job. Vice-President of wrecking stuff.
Nah, I no want anything useful.
I have this fantasy. First, I put the Queen in the trunk of a car. Then, I crush the car. I have other fantasies, but I can't tell you them.
Heh heh heh. Careful. You're EXCITING me.
No. I don't see myself working with you.
Blood! He he... Lots of blood.
I got nothing else to say.
Hey! No more blood.
Come here baby!
Yeah... It sure sounds like fun. I was thinking of killin' her myself, but a...some company might be all right. Just don't be gettin' in my way, cause I won't let anything get in my way.
I'm as strong as an ox... And I'm good at fixin' stuff. Even better at breaking stuff. Just LOVE breakin' heads. Let's do it.
I don't have to steal it! Hey!
You stop fighting first. I want to be alive to talk to you. It better that way.

How do? Franz Hinkle. Purveyor of the finest electronics and other goods in Arulco.
Ja, gut to see you again.
Fascinating what they're doing with wireless these days, no?
Something I can help you with?
Danke, but I have no use for that.
All right then. What do you need?
I look excitable to you, ja? I get upset, I cross wires. It's no good for anyone.
I don't think so. I get all the action I can handle in other ways.
I think... I should see a doctor.
You come see me if you need me.
There's something you want to buy, ja?
Everything's right there. Let me know what interests you.
Ja, I have quite a bit to offer, especially for Arulco, no?
I tried one of those "Don't pay a cent event" sales, but the first five customers were shot dead before they paid a cent. It's unpredictable here. Now, I take my money at time of purchase.
Maybe we can work out a deal for this, no?
Something you'd like to sell, ja?
All right, then. Just give me a minute.
Hm. No, I am only interested in certain things, ja?
Worth nothing! Maybe sell it to an Aussie, ja? They like junk.
Hm. This has seen better days, ja? Cannot give you much.
This looks good. I'll make you fine deal.
Let's see, no, no. There's not enough here for what you want to purchase.
Great! Business is booming. I knew it would pick up.
Good! And here's your change.
You keep me in mind in the future. Remember Franz Hinkle's finest electronics and other goods. Has a ring to it, ja?
Another time, maybe.
Leaving this here?
No offense, but I can't buy anymore right now. I been saving for an omni-directional antenna. Maybe when business picks up, ja?
You have more nerve than common sense!
I feel okay now, ja.
When the shooting stops, you come see me.
The war goes good for you, ja? I am glad to hear this.
Things are tough for you now, ja? Franz cannot pick sides. You try harder. Everybody's a customer.
Well, look at the time, ja? I need to flip the sign to the "closed" side, if you know what I mean.

I am Igmus Palkov..
Call me Iggy.
My nightmares confirm the things I have seen. Ah, I no can talk about it.
I had always thought that I, Igmus Palkov, would become a great admiral in Mother Russia. I do not know what happened.
No. Is of no importance to me.
I see women here carry guns. Women should carry baby. Is pitiful what this war has done.
Who do think you talk to? You must pay for this!
I am not sure.
Need help... urgently.
It is not befitting a soldier to make idle conversation. So I go now.
You are kind.
Is now time for YOU to die!
I am mercenary, too. I take job with man named Mike. I did know nothing of this Queen Deidranna and her sick ways. I am not happy with job. I wish I was back in Mother Russia.
I am good shot and very good at almost everything. I will take pleasure in fighting for the good side. We will kill those traitors to the peoples.
I make you good price. I work for Arulco Army for $2,000. Everyday I get this. But I not expect this much from you.
Good. We kill traitors together.
You have my money. You are a thief!
This is too bad. I will leave Arulco. I will not be a problem.
I happy not to fight you. I do not want money.
You should have paid me, you infidel!

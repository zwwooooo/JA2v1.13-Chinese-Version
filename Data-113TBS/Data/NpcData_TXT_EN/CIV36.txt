I'm glad to be working for ya.
The days don't seem as long now that our hard work is going to a good cause.
No need to waste your time down here. We'll keep an eye on things.
Every shovel full of ore puts us that much closer to freedom. I like coming to work now.
You show that Queen what's what!
We're working as fast as we can. And doin' it with pleasure.
Ya might want to take care of business up top. We got everything under control down here.
Let me tell ya, it's a lot better digging for you guys.
Ya come down here for the peace and quiet? Not much else to do here.
You're doing a great job. And we're working as fast as we can to do our part. Keep it up!

Hello. I am Manny Santos. Maybe you have met brother of me.
Hello. I, um, shoot. I forget your name again.
My brothers, dey tell me, "Manny, one day you be bartender, too." It be good, five Santos brothers all bartenders.
I can mix many drinks. Beer, dis is my favorite.
Um, no. I no need dis.
Dere are many lovely ladies here in Arulco, no? De ladies, dey like me. Dey say I remind them of my brothers that would no date them.
My brothers, dey say, "Manny, is no good to hit de clients." I ask if dey would say dat now.
No, thank you. I am part of de famous Santos brothers. I just wish to be bartender.
Ooh. Uch. Uh. Dis hurts. Need strong drink. Get me Shirley Temple.
I be here if you need me.
A tip! Thank you.
I mix you up nice, no? You tell me what you like.
Take time. Dey say age good for drinks.
You afraid I can no make it?
I can no take dat for drinks. Is cash bar only.
Dey no pay me yet. I am in training, you see? I have no money.
Ooh. Many fun objects...

Yes, but dis cash bar. Sorry.



Hm. No tip? Maybe next time, I serve you better.
And thank you for de tip. Enjoy de drink.
You need another, you call Manny.
Maybe you come back when you thirsty.
You want I should drink this?

You insult de Santos family! You garbage!
Oooh. Much better. Me get drink.
No talk now... de glasses get all shot up. Wait 'til is quiet.
Oh! Dat's it! Is time for me to go home. I no forget last call, did I? Ah, well.
I do dis until I learn de trade. Bartending hard, no? You have de liquor, de glasses, de money, much to do. But one day, I, Manny Santos, will be famous bartender like my brothers.
I like dis place. Charlie, de bartender, he is no mean to me. Teach me how to do job. Yesterday, I learn to make ice. I wonder, though. Charlie, sometimes he mix funny drinks. I no think dey good.
De money is de hardest part for me. I only count to five. I work on it though.
Why you yell at Manny? What I do? Maybe I fix you up with one of Charlie's mean drinks! Is no good to drink those! They hurt peop... oh. Wait. You no hear me say dat. Good bartender no talk, Manny. No talk.
Dis mean I bartender now, no? Sudden opening is like dream come true.

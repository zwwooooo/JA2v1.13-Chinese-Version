Please be respectful of the ruins. They are a gift from our ancestors.
Believe it or not, there was a time when there was so many tourists visiting the ruins that moving around Chitzena was next to impossible.
Chitzena is not the same without the Chalice of Chance. Losing such an artifact was to lose our very souls.

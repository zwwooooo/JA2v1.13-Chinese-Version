I'm nervous...
I am not sure I have what it takes to be a soldier.
How bad does it hurt to be shot?
I am not looking forward to battle.
I hope I will be all right in the next battle.
I never thought myself brave.
I have doubts about my abilities.
I hope it is normal to be so scared.
It is not easy to kill a man, I imagine.
Are you sure I have enough training?
I hope I do not let you down in the next battle.
Maybe the Army will not return. That would be good.
I trust we have been taught everything we must know.
You will not leave us to fight alone, okay?
Perhaps, with more experience, I will not vomit so much.

I don't know no Joey...
Haven't ya got something better to do? Like...isn't there a war going on or something?
She's not my real mother, you know.
She said it was okay - I swear.
I don't want nothing from you.
Ya know, I could show ya around. Introduce you to some of the nicer girls in San Mona.
Ya sound just like my dad.
No way. I didn't come up here to get killed, you know. I came up here to get... ah, never mind.
Uggh... mommy... mommy!
Just leave me alone.
I bet ya won't even give me a chance to spend it before you force me to go home.
Okay, I'll go with you. Just don't let anything happen to me. My mom will be really disappointed if she isn't the one that gets to kill me.
What ya doing? You can't just leave me here! I'll be good... I swear.
I hope my dad's not drunk when I get home. He's gonna kill me... Well maybe, if I'm lucky, he won't be there.
I got lost, Mom... I took a wrong turn, and then I was a little confused as to where I was... and then they found me... I was really lucky, Mom.
Okay, Mom... Uhh, dad hasn't been drinking, has he?
I don't want to join you. I don't want to have anything to do with you. I just want to be left alone down here.
I tell you what... Since I know you're gonna save my skin with my mom, I'll let you in on something... Somebody's stashing cash down here. There's tons of it!
Sure, I'll take it, but I don't need it. This place is full of money.
You're crazy!
No more foolin' around, okay? I'll do exactly what you tell me - I promise!
Make the shooting stop!

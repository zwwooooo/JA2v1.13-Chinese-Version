54:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:If you ever get airborne, don't forget about those SAM sites.

56:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:You can destroy blue flags on mines by throwing grenades on them. Enemies may step on unflagged mines. Then again, you might too.
57:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [L] to look into a direction. Press [L] again to ready your weapon and look through a scope, if one is present on your gun.
58:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Always try to end a turn with your mercs at least crouched. It protects you from unintentional friendly fire.

69:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:HP ammo does great damage but is easily stopped by body armor. AP ammo can penetrate body armor but does less damage.
70:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Unarmored targets, like bloodcats, take a lot of damage from HP ammo.
71:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Helping locals will boost their loyalty. Talking to them may sometimes reveal some useful information as well.
72:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:You need to have a certain level of loyalty in a town before you can train militia there.
73:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Mercs with the Teaching skill train militia faster.
74:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [O] to open up the options menu in-game.

81:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Green militia can be trained further to become regular militia. Regular militia is more useful but costs more to train and maintain.
82:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Veteran militia can't be trained. Militia can become veteran after combat if they performed well.
83:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Try to bandage a dying merc as soon as possible, otherwise the merc may bleed to death.
84:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Always try to give a sidearm to your snipers. Snipers are of limited use in close combat situations.
85:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Stun grenades can help you render enemies helpless. You can steal equipment from helpless enemies.

98:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [ALT]+[Z] to order all your mercs into stealth mode, and [=] to select them all.
99:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Relying on sound is even more important at night. Without the proper equipment you'll hear more than you can see.
100:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Night operations may be your best bet early on, when you are relying on pistols and SMGs.
101:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [G] to toggle the artificial light around mercs on and off.
102:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:If you get caught in a thunderstorm, be on your toes: A flash of lightning can give away your position and the rain makes it harder to see.

105:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Always deal with the present threat before carrying out another plan.

107:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Marbles can be surprisingly useful in a fist fight.
108:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:If you need to get somewhere fast, make sure you don't exceed 100 percent weight on the mercs. It will slow the squad down.
109:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Counting bullets during a fight is tough. Don't be surprised when the mercs forget how many they have left.
110:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Each mercenary has a different approach and effectiveness when talking to an NPC. Different backgrounds may have an effect on them too. Don't expect Biff to be good at threatening people.
111:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Each mercenary has a different sleeping pattern, ranging from 3 to 12 hours to fully restore energy. The "Night Ops" trait reduces this time.
112:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Each mercenary has a different tolerance for the number of merc deaths and your overall reputation in Arulco.
113:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Avoid keeping two people who don't like each other in the same sector for more than an hour.

122:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Exploring the farms and city sectors can uncover lots of useful items, like gas for vehicles.
123:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:In the tactical screen, pressing and holding [RIGHT-MOUSE-BUTTON] over a merc will open up a menu similar to the one on the strategic screen.

129:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Defensive minefields can be safely placed in captured towns and SAMs, as mercs and militia will avoid them.
130:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:You can inspect traps before trying to disarm them. Recommended if you are happy with your current number of extremities.

132:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Placing mines, concertina wire or sandbags is more convenient while holding [SHIFT], relieving the need to manually take a new item from a merc's inventory.
133:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:If you select several mercs and order movement with [SHIFT] pressed, they will move in formation, trying to keep their relative positions.
134:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [SHIFT]+[T] to quickly transform the object in your hand.
135:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [SHIFT]+[O] to quickly transform the scope on your weapon, if you're playing a mod that uses this feature.
136:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [SHIFT]+[Y] to quickly transform the laser sight on your weapon, if you're playing a mod that uses this feature.
137:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [SHIFT]+[L] to quickly transform the flashlight in your hand.
138:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Out of first aid kits after a tough fight? You can use a knife on a corpse to retrieve their uniform, cut the uniform to rags and then combine those to create makeshift bandages.
139:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:You can block enemy fire by carrying a riot shield in your hand. Better shields block more damage.
140:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:If you hover with an empty hand over a map structure, you can sometimes interact with it. Sometimes it's just a sound... sometimes it's something more.
141:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:If a spy talks to unalerted enemies, they can try to secretly recruit them to your cause.
142:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Check out the Features Screen to toggle 1.13 features on and off! You can access it through the Options Screen.

149:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Press [ESC] to: close the Skills Menu, stop moving, stop dragging, unready weapon.
150:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:When deploying mercs, you can use the arrow keys to scroll the map. This is useful in mods that use bigger than normal maps.
151:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Suppress the enemy. Unloading on full auto in their general direction uses up a lot of ammunition, but it can drain the enemy's APs and make them less capable of shooting back.
152:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Fire and maneuver! Split your mercs into two or more groups: while one group moves forward or falls back, the others support them with aimed and suppressive fire.
153:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Single shots from long range are often less effective in the New Chance to Hit (NCTH) system. More liberal use of automatic and burst fire can compensate for lower hit probabilities.
154:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Closing in with the enemy can be dangerous, but it's also often the fastest way to eliminate them.
155:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:In the New Chance to Hit system, the fewer aim levels a weapon has, the fewer APs it needs to reach its maximum aimed accuracy.
156:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Stick to cover! It saves lives.
157:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:Artillery is the king of battle. Just a few well-placed mortar shells or rocket-propelled grenades can turn the tide of an engagement.
158:LOADSCREENHINT/szName:A spotter will increase the accuracy of all nearby mercs who are using sniper rifles. Use the Skills Menu [A] to assign a merc with binoculars in their hands to spotting duty.

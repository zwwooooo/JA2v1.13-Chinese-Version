0:TAUNT/szText:And I've made contact with you! Prepare to die!
1:TAUNT/szText:Couple? We're not married!
2:TAUNT/szText:I don't know, maybe I'll send them my CV after I kill you!
3:TAUNT/szText:PX? What the fuck does that even mean?
3:TAUNT/szTextCensored:PX? What the hell does that even mean?
4:TAUNT/szText:No shit, Sherlock!
5:TAUNT/szText:It will be a one-way trip for you!
6:TAUNT/szText:Oh yes, by all means! Move out in the open!
7:TAUNT/szText:Luck is for wusses, real professionals depend on their skill!
8:TAUNT/szText:What? I can SEE you and HEAR you, you moron!
9:TAUNT/szText:Yeah, and don't even think about a lunch break!
10:TAUNT/szText:I'm sorry, didn't catch the name!
11:TAUNT/szText:Doesn't matter, you'll be dead soon enough.
12:TAUNT/szText:So THAT'S why she didn't get my postcard.
13:TAUNT/szText:Indeed I do!
14:TAUNT/szText:You know there's no such animal, right?
15:TAUNT/szText:Not yet. But soon you'll meet him!
16:TAUNT/szText:Trouble is my second name!
17:TAUNT/szText:Like a bulldog!
18:TAUNT/szText:You should be!
19:TAUNT/szText:Your wish is my command!
20:TAUNT/szText:Nobody ever does.
21:TAUNT/szText:Just wait, and this trouble will run into YOU!
22:TAUNT/szText:Scoundrel? I'll make you eat those words!
23:TAUNT/szText:No, thank you!
24:TAUNT/szText:We'll see who's about to teach whom!
25:TAUNT/szText:You're right!
26:TAUNT/szText:You don't deserve a chance!
27:TAUNT/szText:Horoscopes lie!
28:TAUNT/szText:Ding dong!
29:TAUNT/szText:It's still not too late!
30:TAUNT/szText:We'll check ourselves!
31:TAUNT/szText:Need bubbles, sir?
32:TAUNT/szText:Did you just call me an ass?!
33:TAUNT/szText:Whatever.
34:TAUNT/szText:I didn't understand a single word!
35:TAUNT/szText:It will only get closer!
36:TAUNT/szText:I'm not really evil... just misunderstood.
37:TAUNT/szText:It's about to turn into full tournee!
38:TAUNT/szText:"Stupid fools"? Are you even trying?
39:TAUNT/szText:As you wish!
40:TAUNT/szText:Hey! I'm a lady!
41:TAUNT/szText:I'll dig you one! Six feet under!
42:TAUNT/szText:Don't worry, I'll send you some!
43:TAUNT/szText:I'll show you!
44:TAUNT/szText:You'll wish you wouldn't ask!
45:TAUNT/szText:You got it wrong, let me educate you!
46:TAUNT/szText:Was that a rhetorical question?
47:TAUNT/szText:Now, whose fault is it, if your cocksucker boss buys second hand guns?
47:TAUNT/szTextCensored:Now, whose fault is it, if your cheap ass boss buys second hand guns?
48:TAUNT/szText:And soon so will be you!
49:TAUNT/szText:The only thing layin' low here is you, bitch!
50:TAUNT/szText:Yeah right, that's why you're sweating!
51:TAUNT/szText:Advice for today: avoid long travels, new relationships and BULLETS!
52:TAUNT/szText:Mine said I will kill a lot of people today! I hope it will come true too!
53:TAUNT/szText:Do people seriously believe in those things? Pathetic.
54:TAUNT/szText:Tough? I could make that shot with my eyes closed.
55:TAUNT/szText:And that's just the beginning!
56:TAUNT/szText:He loves you no more!
57:TAUNT/szText:OK, this one's out. Next!
58:TAUNT/szText:You'll be sorry for saying that!
59:TAUNT/szText:Well, now we can play hide and seek!
60:TAUNT/szText:You're right! It's the whole company here!
61:TAUNT/szText:You should have used the plural! Guys, lots of guys!
62:TAUNT/szText:We'll see about that...
63:TAUNT/szText:No, it doesn't, but don't worry, we'll be gentle!
64:TAUNT/szText:Nice grammar, asshole!
65:TAUNT/szText:Need supplies, wacko?
66:TAUNT/szText:Here, I'll give you some!
67:TAUNT/szText:No, you just suck, that's it! No air involved!
68:TAUNT/szText:Never got this - why bring a knife to a gun fight?
69:TAUNT/szText:Funny indeed, we had so much fun with him as target practice!
70:TAUNT/szText:I know some jokes too. For example: you're a joke!
71:TAUNT/szText:Hey man, the gun isn't stupid, you are!
72:TAUNT/szText:Suits you fine, huh?
73:TAUNT/szText:Relax! Why make such a fuss?
74:TAUNT/szText:The only thing you're gonna get is your butt kicked!
75:TAUNT/szText:Oh yeah? Wait for the next one!
76:TAUNT/szText:It was just a warning shot!
77:TAUNT/szText:I'll scratch you to death!
78:TAUNT/szText:That's not a scratch. It's a fucking canyon!
78:TAUNT/szTextCensored:That's not a scratch. It's a freaking canyon!
79:TAUNT/szText:No. You need to die!
80:TAUNT/szText:I'll dig you one too with it!
81:TAUNT/szText:Kiss my ass!
82:TAUNT/szText:Fireball? What the fuck do you think this is, some kind of video game?
82:TAUNT/szTextCensored:Fireball? What the hell do you think this is, some kind of video game?
83:TAUNT/szText:It's OK, I'm here. Follow my voice!
84:TAUNT/szText:That's what she said!
85:TAUNT/szText:Please, let it be a close encounter of the sexy kind!
86:TAUNT/szText:I'm ready any time you are!
87:TAUNT/szText:Now, now, you're hurting our feelings!
88:TAUNT/szText:Come on, there's always a room to try something new!
89:TAUNT/szText:Come over here, I'll give you some.
90:TAUNT/szText:Is that what it's called these days?
91:TAUNT/szText:That must be the first time you've ever said that!
92:TAUNT/szText:Oh, now I'm getting jealous.
93:TAUNT/szText:I can help you deal with the grief, if you want!
94:TAUNT/szText:Where? Where?
95:TAUNT/szText:Maybe I could help you with that?
96:TAUNT/szText:You need to empty the chamber...
97:TAUNT/szText:But that's nothing new for you, eh?
98:TAUNT/szText:Damn, that doesn't even deserve a witty response!
99:TAUNT/szText:Are you even listening to what you're saying?
100:TAUNT/szText:Oh, I'll give you one! Just you wait!
101:TAUNT/szText:You should consider changing your masseur. I volunteer!
102:TAUNT/szText:Yeah, I bet you did. God.
103:TAUNT/szText:Oooh. Not today!
104:TAUNT/szText:No!
105:TAUNT/szText:Anything for you, princess.
106:TAUNT/szText:I work this way on women.
107:TAUNT/szText:Are you doing this on purpose?
108:TAUNT/szText:Pffft.
109:TAUNT/szText:Pffft.
110:TAUNT/szText:I'm just going to pretend I didn't hear that.
111:TAUNT/szText:Hold on! I'll just drop my clothes, get my rescue tube and I'm coming to save you!

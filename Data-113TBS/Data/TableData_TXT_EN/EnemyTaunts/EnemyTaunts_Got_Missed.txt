3:TAUNT/szText:Don't make me go over there!
4:TAUNT/szText:You've just made a huge mistake!
5:TAUNT/szText:I'll take that gun out of your cold hands!
6:TAUNT/szText:You'll regret missing!
7:TAUNT/szText:Who were you shootin' at?
8:TAUNT/szText:Who taught you to shoot?
9:TAUNT/szText:You'll pay for that!
10:TAUNT/szText:Son of a bitch!

15:TAUNT/szText:Learn how to shoot, rookie!
16:TAUNT/szText:In your dreams!
17:TAUNT/szText:Not impressed!
18:TAUNT/szText:That ain't gonna happen.
19:TAUNT/szText:Booooo!
20:TAUNT/szText:Children shouldn't play with guns!
21:TAUNT/szText:Nice try!
22:TAUNT/szText:My grandma's a better shot!
23:TAUNT/szText:That shot was bad and you should feel bad!
24:TAUNT/szText:Close enough.
25:TAUNT/szText:Can't touch this!
26:TAUNT/szText:Oh, don't let the disappointment get to you.
27:TAUNT/szText:Get back in the kitchen where you belong, woman!
28:TAUNT/szText:That was close.
29:TAUNT/szText:Try harder!
30:TAUNT/szText:Whew!
31:TAUNT/szText:Hell no!
32:TAUNT/szText:Maybe next time!
33:TAUNT/szText:Not today!
34:TAUNT/szText:Close, but no cigar.
35:TAUNT/szText:That woke me up.
36:TAUNT/szText:Is that the best you can do?
37:TAUNT/szText:Very pretty, but can you fight?
38:TAUNT/szText:Shit, shit, shit...
39:TAUNT/szText:We're all gonna die.
40:TAUNT/szText:God help me.
41:TAUNT/szText:We're in some real pretty shit right now!
42:TAUNT/szText:It ain't a dream! This is really happening!
43:TAUNT/szText:Where is the goddamn cavalry?
44:TAUNT/szText:Don't make me angry!
45:TAUNT/szText:Is that the best you can do?
46:TAUNT/szText:Very pretty, but can you fight?
47:TAUNT/szText:Oh, I'm laughing at your superior skills!
48:TAUNT/szText:Is that your best?
49:TAUNT/szText:It's official: YOU SUCK!
50:TAUNT/szText:You cannot hurt me!
51:TAUNT/szText:Aw, come on, why so serious? Can't you take a joke?
52:TAUNT/szText:Let's not make a big deal out of nothing!
53:TAUNT/szText:Are you trying to piss me off?
54:TAUNT/szText:Do you want to hurt me on purpose?
55:TAUNT/szText:Oh... I'd love to smack you right now!
56:TAUNT/szText:Wow, you're even dumber than you look.
57:TAUNT/szText:Idiots! Idiots everywhere!
58:TAUNT/szText:You fight so badly you make even onions cry.
59:TAUNT/szText:I guess the only fan you have is the one on the ceiling.
60:TAUNT/szText:Do you always take yourself so seriously?
61:TAUNT/szText:Hey clown, have you come here to amuse me?
62:TAUNT/szText:Next time try shooting with open eyes!
63:TAUNT/szText:Are you always this stupid or is it a special occasion?
64:TAUNT/szText:Now, you've got my attention!
65:TAUNT/szText:You're so cute when you're trying to shoot!
66:TAUNT/szText:You're so cute when you're trying to shoot!
67:TAUNT/szText:Hey babe, you should know how to please me by now...
68:TAUNT/szText:Blast it! You've spent so many bullets, you've got me confused!
69:TAUNT/szText:How about that? I've got a superpower and I didn't even know about it - I can dodge bullets!
70:TAUNT/szText:You think shooting me is gonna solve your problems?
71:TAUNT/szText:Bored! Bored! Bored! You're boring...
72:TAUNT/szText:Are you trying to shoot me or did your gun just fart?
73:TAUNT/szText:Don't ever stop trying, who knows, maybe a miracle will happen!
74:TAUNT/szText:Try again, honey! No pressure. No judgment. I'm here!
75:TAUNT/szText:Try again, honey! No pressure. No judgment. I'm here!
76:TAUNT/szText:OK, keep shooting, I'll yawn when you hit something!
77:TAUNT/szText:Hey, stop shooting! I'm on the phone with my mom!
78:TAUNT/szText:Ouch, I'm hit, I'm hit... No, just kiddin'!
79:TAUNT/szText:Guys, what should we do with this one, shoot him or starve him to death?
80:TAUNT/szText:Guys, what should we do with this one, shoot her or starve her to death?
81:TAUNT/szText:Oh my god, my heart almost stopped beating!
82:TAUNT/szText:I'm scared to death!
83:TAUNT/szText:Gee, that gave me goose bumps!
84:TAUNT/szText:Speak of the devil!
85:TAUNT/szText:Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!
86:TAUNT/szText:Where did that come from?
87:TAUNT/szText:That's what I thought. You're a gutless turd!
88:TAUNT/szText:Need a scope on that blade?
89:TAUNT/szText:Give me that, I'll do it myself!
90:TAUNT/szText:I ain't your punching bag, boy!
91:TAUNT/szText:I ain't your punching bag, girl!
92:TAUNT/szText:Well, if it ain't Muhammad Ali... Drunk!
93:TAUNT/szText:Boxing... not your strongest suit, huh?
94:TAUNT/szText:You fight like a girl!
95:TAUNT/szText:You fight like a girl... Oh, nevermind.
96:TAUNT/szText:Not sure if that's the best moment - but you really should invest in some Mentos!
97:TAUNT/szText:I love it when they try to fight back!

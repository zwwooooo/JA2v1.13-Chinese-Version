0:TAUNT/szText:Is this some kind of a joke?
1:TAUNT/szText:There's no more room in hell!
2:TAUNT/szText:They're coming to get us!
3:TAUNT/szText:Great, that's exactly what this country needs. A fucking zombie apocalypse!
3:TAUNT/szTextCensored:Great, that's exactly what this country needs. A freaking zombie apocalypse!
4:TAUNT/szText:Remember, aim for the head, aim for the head...
5:TAUNT/szText:Really? I mean.. c'mon!
6:TAUNT/szText:That's just fucked up!
6:TAUNT/szTextCensored:That's just messed up!
7:TAUNT/szText:What's next? Werewolves? Vampires?
8:TAUNT/szText:Come for me! Come on, you rotting corpse!
9:TAUNT/szText:I'll send you back to hell!
10:TAUNT/szText:Send them more paramedics!
11:TAUNT/szText:Oh shit! It can smell my brain!
12:TAUNT/szText:It's not zombie! Technically, they're just infected...
13:TAUNT/szText:Is this running one or walking one? I'm confused...
14:TAUNT/szText:It's alive!
15:TAUNT/szText:Maybe it's friendly.
16:TAUNT/szText:It's alive... ish.
17:TAUNT/szText:Nothing's ever real until it's real.
18:TAUNT/szText:They live!
19:TAUNT/szText:There must be some rational explanation. Virus, space radiation, maybe a meteor...
20:TAUNT/szText:I will not negotiate with undead!
21:TAUNT/szText:So there IS a life after death!
22:TAUNT/szText:Holy shit. Plot twist!
23:TAUNT/szText:Fuck, I think I forgot to take my pills.
23:TAUNT/szTextCensored:Crap, I think I forgot to take my pills.
24:TAUNT/szText:That's it, no more drugs for me.
25:TAUNT/szText:I knew that movie was based on a true story!
26:TAUNT/szText:You're one spooky motherfucker, man.
26:TAUNT/szTextCensored:You're one spooky dude, man.
27:TAUNT/szText:Oooh. Zombies. How original.
28:TAUNT/szText:Zombie over here!
29:TAUNT/szText:Fuck global warming, we've got real problems here!
29:TAUNT/szTextCensored:Screw global warming, we've got real problems here!
30:TAUNT/szText:Undead!
31:TAUNT/szText:This is a bad dream!
32:TAUNT/szText:Blasphemy!
33:TAUNT/szText:Come on! It wasn't even 17 seconds!
34:TAUNT/szText:At a certain point in your life you realize you know more dead people than living.
35:TAUNT/szText:I'm scared to pieces!
36:TAUNT/szText:It's amazing how fast the world can go from bad to total shit storm.
37:TAUNT/szText:It could be worse. They could be nazi!
38:TAUNT/szText:Where's my lawnmower when I need it?
39:TAUNT/szText:It's against the nature, you freak!
40:TAUNT/szText:Hmmm... I bet I would make a cool zombie myself.
41:TAUNT/szText:No! I don't want to become one of you!
42:TAUNT/szText:Stay away from my precious gray matter!
43:TAUNT/szText:Please, don't eat me! I'm fat and have too much sugar in my blood!
44:TAUNT/szText:Aaaah! Should I cut it off now?!
45:TAUNT/szText:They're gonna eat me! Oh my GOOOOOOD!
46:TAUNT/szText:Not my face! My beautiful face!
47:TAUNT/szText:Oh, the PAIN!
48:TAUNT/szText:Suddenly, I'm getting a real hankering for brains!
49:TAUNT/szText:And stay dead! This time!
50:TAUNT/szText:You're dead... again.
51:TAUNT/szText:Rest in pieces!
52:TAUNT/szText:If it stands up again, I'm gonna piss myself.
53:TAUNT/szText:Stay down!
54:TAUNT/szText:Get back where you came from!
55:TAUNT/szText:Zed is dead.
56:TAUNT/szText:Looks like someone here had a bad morning.
57:TAUNT/szText:Now that's what I call a genre shift!
58:TAUNT/szText:You know what could come in handy right now? A freaking chainsaw!
59:TAUNT/szText:Quickly, someone distract them with fireworks or something!
60:TAUNT/szText:*whistles* It's a dead man's party! Who could ask for more...
61:TAUNT/szText:It's time to kick some zombie ass!
62:TAUNT/szText:If it bleeds, I can kill it!
63:TAUNT/szText:Men, women, children, zombies... I'll kill all of you!
64:TAUNT/szText:It lives... again!
65:TAUNT/szText:Hey! That's an insurance scam!
66:TAUNT/szText:OK, that's just ridiculous.
67:TAUNT/szText:Looks like someone got out of the wrong side of the grave!
68:TAUNT/szText:Yup, that should work. Unless it's one of these modern zombies, that are actually infected or some other bullshit.
69:TAUNT/szText:Either it's dead for good, or about to grow two new ones. Let's hope for the former.

Adversaries.
At last. With any luck there'll be a couple of males to shoot.
I got my hands full.
Another one.
There's something about it that reminds me of Lynx.
Wonder what kind of pet these things would make.
Thought I heard something... could be wrong.
Ouf, those things even smell like Lynx, especially in the morning.
I'm ready... for whatever.
Maybe I'll get to kill a cock-a-roach.
I just love the attention.
Something right there.
Here.
Need lead.
Let me die! It'll end the misery.



Why do I bother?
Firearm's jammed!
Give me the chance, and you're dead meat.
That was refreshing.
You call that close?
You can't be serious...
I caught one.
Want some down time.
Panting like a rabid dog.
Much deserved.
Piss off!
I can't believe I wasted my life on that man. Just looking at Lynx makes me vomit.

Lynx deserves to die... slowly... with me watching the whole thing, from the beginning to its glorious conclusion.
I'd rather have blown away Lynx, but Mike makes a fine second choice.
Doubt there's an ear to collect.
I'm fine. Just don't piss me off!
I could use something to do.
No.
I did my job. But there were things about her I admired.
I have absolutely nothing against females, especially mothers, other than the fact that they give birth to males.
What do you expect from one of them.
I'm getting depressed. I should just go on a rampage and shoot up the place.
This whole group makes me cringe. Killing a couple might put a smile on my face.
Check the skies!
Crap! Crap! Crap! If I got anything decent in terms of equipment, I'd know it would be a mistake.
Pick one, anyone. I feel like killing somebody.
Let me make it clear, I hate everybody. And I do mean everybody!
Pinch me!
Brain surgeon, for sure.
What a freakin' shock that was.
You brought that son-of-a-bitch, Lynx, down here. Well, let me make my feelings known. He's a two-timer who's only alive because I haven't yet figured out the most gratifying way to kill him.




Ya. Like I'm in a rush!
Mike... He'll do!
I can't see squat!
Boring, boring, boring.
He can consider himself lucky... I'll let him live.
All right! I'm anticipating fun. We've got playmates in this section.
Pisses me off! I haven't got all day to look for 'em. Bunch of wieners.

I don't carry it around just to look good, jackass!
I'm sure that's Joey Graham. I say we castrate him. Put an end to his wandering ways.
Look pal, don't worry about the welcoming committee. Let's just get to work. I'm a professional here. Show me some targets.
That's the end of them.
You know, why is it that when I get something from a man, there's always less in the box than I expected?
Bitter, cruel and heartless. Not much else you can do.
Here pussycat. I got some catnip for ya.
Yeah! You know, we did all right. Nothing like a woman and a gun, I tell you. Hell hath no fury! You remember that.
They pulled out early. Typical men.
I'm feeling very irritable and unproductive. I'm going to get some sleep.
I'm up and back at the grindstone.
Same here.
Where'd this stuff come from? A garage sale? It's not working.
Hmm... it's rigged.
That looks more suspicious than a happy man.
Just let me drown... Timing couldn't be better.
Yeah! I made it. So, what now?

Ya, right. Like you have the slightest clue about what you're doing! Take a hike!

Take a long walk down a short pier. I'm doing my nails.
Ya, like I've been waiting around for you. I got plans!
Buzz Garneau is not here now. Say what you must. Be advised that any male callers will die long before they ever hear from me.
Whatever.
I ain't going to be a part of it, and you don't really want me to be. Otherwise, Lynx is a deadman.

Think again. I could vomit just imagining spending more time with Lynx. As a matter of fact, I think I will... vomit, that is.
So what's the deal? You want me to stick around, or what?
Okay, so I'm staying.
Yeah... I guess.



It's been loads and loads of fun, but now it's time to go home and program my VCR.
Listen closely. I told you...
Can't see how. You'll probably have to sell your body to get the cash to pay me, and I haven't got that kind of time.
Like I'll even remember you.

I'm listening...
Did you catch my marksmanship? I'm skilled in all types of weapons.
I'm waiting.
What are you willing to commit to?
I haven't got time for this bullshit!
I'll go... Just keep me away from that whore-son, Lynx, and men in general.

Just so you know, this contract is nearly over. Consider yourself informed.
What can I say? I'm justified asking for more.

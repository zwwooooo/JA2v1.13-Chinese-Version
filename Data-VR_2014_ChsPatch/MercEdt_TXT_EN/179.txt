There's someone looking to die.
This one's gonna die with surprise plastered across the face.
Which one to choose?
I found something to shoot.
I found something to shoot.
Did you lose it for a minute?
I'm getting really paranoid.
I'm getting really paranoid.
I'm expierencing anxiety build-up. This area looks awfully suspicious.
Yeah. Right.
Which one to choose?
What's this?
I wonder who this belongs to?
I got no ammo, and I'm getting really paranoid.
This is it... I'm dying. So peaceful. So many colors...
Larry always was a little accident-prone. I might even miss him.


I was daydreaming and now... I'm confused.
This gun! Useless...
I don't scare that easily.
I felt rushed.
The nerve of this guy! Shooting at me.
I don't mind firing for nothing...
Oh neat. I'm bleeding.
I doubt I'll sleep tonight.
I have no energy.
It's such a let down when they finally die...
It's such a let down when they finally die...
The voice on that Sparky just drives me insane.


Hang on! I think he's still breathing.
You only made one mistake! Being here.
What a day. My!
Boring, boring, boring. I'm not spillng my fair share of blood.
Forget it.
You know what's strange? I can never remember how many people I killed.
I think I've just heard a fat lady singing.
Wait till your mom meets me.
If I was you, I'd start looking underneath my bunk.
I got a real hankering... to kill somebody.

This is a piece of useless junk. We should just chuck it.
Alright. You're my paycheck. Just don't tell me we're wearing yellow.
I like to kill. I even like to watch killings. But when I don't get to do enough of my own killing, I don't go back. Ever.
My old man wouldn't even let me light the barbecue.
He's crazier than me! I've gotta get out of here.
You're a loser.
If I, like... hear that, like... Sparky chick's voice again, I'm gonna, like, blow her freakin' brains out!

Larry's the man. He's almost gifted.


Your time is up. I've had it with you.
I'm gonna kill you! Then I'm gonna eat you! I'm gonna start with your ears. They're the best part when you know how to cook 'em. Crispy... not burned.
I'll never forget this.
Yeah. Just what was your point?
You know any women?
I'd never miss the chance to get in on a good shootin'!
Hang on. The job ain't done... till I say it's done.

It must be Christmas!
Loser.
I can't get out of this hellhole fast enough.
Everyone on that team... is dead.
I just love for somebody to try and get this off of us.
Did you lose it for a minute?
Dogs of war!
I find this whole mission thing... a real distraction. But now that it's done, we can go back to killin' people... right?
We can clean our guns now. Don't think we'll be seeing any more of them for a while.

It's time to go back.
I guess.
This is a piece of useless junk. We should just chuck it.
It's wired. But it's an amateur job.
We step in the wrong place - and it's ka-blooey!
What a rush! I'm about to drown...
If I don't spot something to shoot soon, I'm gonna shoot myself.

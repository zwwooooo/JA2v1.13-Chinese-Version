Target in sight.
Got something to say before you die?
I'll give you a head start before I shoot you.
Back away. Target in sight.
Aww... just back away.
Look. An organ bank?
I've got an enemy who hasn't seen me.
(sniff) They're out there.
I'm tempting fate.
Go slowly here. They are out there... somewhere.
I've got a couple in proximity.
Came across something over here.
Look. Something over here.
Get me some ammo!
Need... a medic here.
Losing Scully... it's like... losing a brother.



My firearm is jammed!
Big mistake gunner boy.
I've got a problem here.
They'll have to do better than that.
I'm unable to sight the target.
Need to be patched.
<Yawn Don't forget about time.
I have to catch my breath.
Welcome to the club.
Target is eliminated.




Just like old times.

I've done it without a problem.
I'm not interested.
And just so there's no confusion. You're terminated!
Target is terminated!
You're trash. And everyone knows it.
I've been there already. I've got nothing but sour memories.
Whatever team I may be on has to bag missions on a consistent basis. It's an image thing!
Back away!
Even I can't get this damn thing to work!
I can't operate with mercenaries I don't trust!

I'm too good to work with others.
Have you lost your mind?
I get the impression you're grabbing at straws.


Scully takes to the point like noone else.


I don't care which side I work for. I go where the cash is...
I'm gone!
I... I'm unable to sight the target.
No can do!
Okay! Surprise surprise...
Enemy encountered... want to engage.
They're out there... somewhere.

You're terminated!
You're trash boy.
I can't say I am asked to leave an assignment very often... but I have no problem with the request.
Platoon eliminated.
It seems someone has been doing some digging. Getting it back shouldn't be a problem.
You're eliminated.
Back away. Target in sight.
Another successful mission. It just goes to show you what spending that little extra can do for you.
Just remember... Mike's on your case! I have to live up to my reputation and I ain't sleeping till you're dead!


I'm sure I mentioned that.
This damn thing is jammed!
Whoever rigged it didn't do much of a job. I should be able to disable it.
Go slowly here. It seems someone has been doing some digging.

Okay, everything checks out... I'm yours.





























You can call me Mike. I don't have a last name.
I don't care which side I work for.
Point is?
Either you attempt to hire me or someone else will.
That wouldn't buy a minute of my time.


Another day another dollar. Or a couple of thousand for that matter...
You're gonna have to open the purse strings a little wider.

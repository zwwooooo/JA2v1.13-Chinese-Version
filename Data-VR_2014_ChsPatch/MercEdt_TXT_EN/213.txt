You're dead!
Ha ha, this is going to be fun.
This is what I live for!
Trouble.
Looks like we've got company.
I think you're a fool to stay down here.
Stranger still.
I suppose an accurate way to describe this place would be... cesspool or dump?

Believe me, you'll want to hear this.
Time for fun and games.
I see it, don't worry.
Look...
Damn.
I'm pretty bad here.
We only wanted the challenge of the battle and glory from it.  Win or lose.  And we lost.
Win or lose.  As long as the fight is worthy then honour is gained.  The glory of having triumphed over impossible odds is what drives us.
I can't babysit them all.

I need a better weapon!
It gets old.  Very old.
Hey, don't worry.
Lucky for you.
Maybe?  I guess you won't know until you give it a shot.
A real warrior knows his own limits and doesn't over estimate himself.
I just need... time.
I don't feel so hot.
Die!
This one's gone!
I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to your friend aren't I?
You got another plan sister or are just objecting cause you didn't think of it.
I can say the same about you.  That makes us even.
Doesn't matter anyway.
I trust I've satisfied your curiosity for now?
Keep your distance a bit.
Come on boys lets move out.
Settle down, Kid...Besides, you know the arrangement.
There are some vicious people.
It was the moment of my life.
Damn you're stubbon!
Assassin, Mercenary, those are names people give guys like me who do the killing to make us seem better or worse in their eyes.
You want to another war story, huh...I knew you were the type.
So deal with it.
Ha! I was the best.


Mercs like me are in high demand.
Settle down kid.

Good luck.  You're going to need it.
I don't have time to stick around here anyway.
I like the way you handled that.
Very impressive.
You seem like you know how to get results.
Forfeit.
Exactly the person I'm looking for.
Eyes don't work anymore.
Is there something else?
If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table.
This is gonna be good.
One more time.
Ha, stimulants make a warrior even out of the weakest human.
Mighty generous of you.  A little too generous if you ask me.
That's just the kind of person I'm looking for.
I've got a plan to escape.
They give no thrill in battle.  No honour or glory in defeating them.  It was like stepping on bugs.
I don't like getting cheated.
I've killed many people.  I can't say I'm proud of it but I have.  Criminals, competitors, businessmen, police, women, children...
Vermin
Killing is never enough.  Anyone can kill just by pushing a button.  A warrior fights his battles himself.
Too bad, I was looking forward to cracking some heads.


It might be your only chance.
Chaos.
Carefully...
Hold on just a second.

Let's get moving again.

I'm someone you don't want get on the bad side of, and I'm not one for small talk.
Sorry.
Why are you asking me about it?

I figured you'd be back.
I... I think this has affected me in ways I... I didn't anticipate.  I think I'll need... time to sort things out.
What?  You think I don't have something better to do?
This isn't really the best place to have these kind of conversations.
I don't like it.
I think I'm something different now.  Maybe more, maybe less.
Glad to hear it.  I'll be waiting right here.
Fair enough.
I don't like working with strangers either but we don't have much choice.  We need each other.
I think... I think I need something more than killing and fighting in my life.  I need a purpose or something like that.
Trying to pick a fight?  I can see you're not too bright.
This looks like the end of our partnership.
Your choice.  I'm here if you want something done right.
Ah ah aaah, not yet.
Maybe in the future but not now.
This thing... I... I don't know give me some time and I'll be able to sort his out on my own.
They're nothing more than bandits now.
Don't make threats, we make promises.  But I'm just trying to give you a friendly warning.
Normally I'd make you regret those words.
Either way I think by following you I can get something out of it.
But I think now with you, I may finally find opponents worth fighting.
I guess I could give you a little tip to make your life easier.
Is there something else you wanted?
But we've got a small problem...If you want me to help you, you've got to bring something to the table.
Come speak to me.
Sooner or later you'll figure this out.
But don't take too long.
So heres the deal.
Come back and speak to me again when you've come to your senses.
Let me give you some advice.  Forget about it.  Do yourself a favour and just head back from where you came.
Yeah, what do you want?
Settle down kid.
What do you say?  Do we have a deal?

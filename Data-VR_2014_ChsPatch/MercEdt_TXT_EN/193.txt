See you later.  If you survive.
Well now I can't tell if thats your face or your behind, but in a moment it won't matter.
And it looks like we have more lambs to the slaughter.
Lets attack.
About time.
Hold on something isn't right.
Keep your eyes open and your weapon handy.  I smell a ambush.
Been poisoned <retch>

I have been on both sides.  Prey and predator.  And if you think your a predator your usually wrong.  Your always someone's prey.
What now?
Now now.  Look at this.
Look.
Wait a moment.
I see you all, in the hells.




My weapon isn't doing anything.
Someone cover me.
We need to keep moving.
I need a hand.  Get over here.
Thats too bad but right now you have bigger problems.
I'm loosing blood over here.
About time to rest.
<gasp>
As useless as they were when they were alive.
I could care less.




I'll drink to that.
Everyone gather up,  We need to regroup.
Done.
Ah ah.
You win some.  You lose some.
Die.
Why are you talking to me now?
Out of the way already.
This is as boring as watching mold grow.
I don't like it.
And then there's places like here where people like me are shaped into glorius heroes.


And then there's places like here where people like me are shaped into glorius heroes.
Keep irritating me and they won't find all the pieces of your body.






I'm coming back for it after we're done here.
Follow my lead and don't try to be clever.
Listen with your ears.
I can't do that.  Ask someone else.
There now maybe I'm speaking to someone with some sense.  There's learning in fighting and killing.  And more in fighting for something you believe in.
About time we got to killing.
Lets end this.
Thats a good sign.
What a surprise.
Yeah.  Something you need?
Enough of this.  Lets get out of here.
All wrapped up here.
Be careful.  You don't want to cross me.
Has it been that long since you've seen a real man?
Target practice.
The most fun I had in years.
Thought as much.


Don't we all.
I'd move if I didn't have all this crap weighing me down.
Everyone.  Stop where you are.
Hold on.

Try to keep up.

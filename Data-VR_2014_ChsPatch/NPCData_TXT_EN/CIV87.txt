Well it's a whole lot more easier working without having soldiers breathing down your neck.
I don't give two shits about you, the Queen or Arulco, I just care about my money.
Watch where you're walking! We've just started drilling this shift.
I was nowhere near Deepwater Horizon, that's all just rumours.
The Queen can kiss my ass.
Work output is on schedule, you'll be getting your cut soon enough.
You take care of the fighting. We'll take care of the mining.
Once this shift is over, me and few of the other roughnecks are heading to San Mona to party!
How much does one of those rifles cost anyways?
I heard once they're done with all of this, they're gonna move inland and start frakking for gas.

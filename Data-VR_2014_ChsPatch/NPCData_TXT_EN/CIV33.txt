Who is Mendax?
My Daddy came home with his face all bashed, Mommy said it was Cockeye.
Look! This pot holder is for my mum.
The bombs scare me.
Tina helps me with English, I think I speak better than her.
Don't let the Queen get me!
Are you Tina's boyfriend?
Got some candy G.I. Joe?
Every Thursday we have sewing class, but I don't like needles.
One day I will grow up and fight against the Queen.
There is a bully in Drassen, he drinks lots and beats up everyone in town.
My brother says it's a lot better here since Doreen left.
You bad men! Bad men with guns!
You guys look funny!
I don't want to pass the bar to get home, Cockeye will get me! I take the long way home!

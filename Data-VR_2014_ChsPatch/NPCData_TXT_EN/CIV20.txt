It will be a long war, but we have learned to be patient.
You mustn't tell anyone of this hideout.
We stand together for our freedom. And many do the same in the forests and hills.
We are not going to lose. Our allies in the hills will keep Deidranna's forces at bay.
This place is not comfortable, but it has kept us alive.
I hope together we can defeat Queen Deidranna.
Queen Deidranna's army is looking for us.
Most of our homes have been destroyed.
Even though we hide now, soon we will emerge to fight for our liberty.
You must not be seen coming here or you will give us away.
I hope we can have our revenge on Deidranna.
You have to find Miguel! Without him the rebels lack leadership.
Most of us have lost loved ones.
We have faith that Miguel will lead us to victory.
We have gone through many things...many deaths.

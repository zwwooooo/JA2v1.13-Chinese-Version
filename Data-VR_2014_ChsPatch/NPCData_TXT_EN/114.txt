Hello I'm Agatha. Are you guys from A.I.M.?
Ah, there you are again. Do you still have any questions?
Thanks.
What took you so long? With reinforcements, our troops would have been able to defend the base.
Thanks ;-)
Well, I don't have anything I could give you.
I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, but you should really stop yelling at me now.
Too dangerous for me... I'm taking care of logistics.
Would you please get a doctor immediately?
Need to get out of here.
I don't have any use for the cash, I'm looking for our people, but thank you.
You stupid monkey!
I'm working for the Agency. There are many issues that have to be investigated.
The insurance won't pay our casualties, if they find witnesses of self-causing. You know what that means!

We think that there've been spies in our camp. Somebody must have informed the enemy about the absence of a large part of our force.
The mercs Joey, Frazzler, Fish, all knew it, had a maneuver this day. Also missed are Iggy, Conrad and Bubba.
Most rebels have been killed, but Miguel was sentenced to death for the propaganda campaign and will be eaten by bloodcats in the football stadium.
You must find Miguel! If he could flee, morale of our troops would rise!
Miguel is, as our agents report, neither in Tixa nor Alma. But there's a labor camp in the desert and there's a palace of justice in Balime, he could also be in the stadium?
Find Miguel! and the missed mercs, if any of them should be a traitor: let him disappear!
To finance this operation I advise to cover the mines and oilrigs.
I heard that you find Miguel! What you told me about some of my ex-mercs isn't very good.
That's what I'll note in their documents: death as a result of "direct" contact with enemies. With your confirmation of course. Then it'll go to the insurance.

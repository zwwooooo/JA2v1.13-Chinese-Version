I am not regular army. You will know this shortly.
Now you face a worthy opponent.
You have not killed anyone like me yet.
You will taste my superior training.
The Arulco army are mostly boys. Us, Elite soldiers, are another story.
This time you fight against a man.
Forget the rest, now you must kill the best.
You have had your practice. Let us see if you learned anything.
Killing you will be easy.
You are barely worth my time.
Your fun has come to an end.
You are a joke!
Come. Come fight with real soldier.
I am not one of the little boys you are used to killing.
It will hurt me to waste a bullet on you.

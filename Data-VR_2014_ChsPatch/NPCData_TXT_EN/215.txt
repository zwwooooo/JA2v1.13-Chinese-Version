How you doing? Jerry Melo... Professional chopper pilot. Grounded. Man, these things don't exactly glide.
That's cool, man. Real cool!
Should be making tracks, man.
Me? I'm headed west.
Can't say I'm looking for anything else to carry back, man.
No, I didn't "just crash," man. I was on a totally legit cargo run to Tracona. Some freaking jerks shot me down just over the border! They've got a whole base set up down there, ready for World War Three. Barely got my ass out in one piece.
Leave it alone. Drop it already!
Heck... No! You dudes aren't off to a very good start, man.
I'm messed up... bad... man.
This whole scene is making me nervous, man.
Maybe I'll find somewhere to spend it on the way back.
Is that's the thanks I get, you freakin' jerk?
Guess I kinda owe you, man. I was almost cat food.
I'm a pilot... not a commando. Take care of this before I blow a bowel, man...






These dudes have a bunch of anti-air missile sites set up all over the country. You ought to take care of them unless you're cool with flying around with rockets up your butt.


Pretty much ready to go...



That's it? Buckle down. There's no in-flight meals.
That's too far, man. These things don't exactly glide.
I'm a pilot... not a commando.
Can't get the chopper down with a bunch of dudes shooting at us, man.
Still got your butt here in one piece. Think that was easy, man?
These things don't float on their own! Make some decisions!
Flight's over, man. No refunds.
We got dudes crawling all over down here, man.
Check it out, man.













Mechanic is just finishing up with some last minute tinkering.


Made a lot of noise. Someone's bound to check it out, man.
Everyone in one piece? Man! Those things don't exactly glide... We're lucky to still be here.
Don't go ragging on me. You try flying a rock, man.
That's cool, man. Just give me the word when it's time to crank her up.
Enjoy your stay... And bring us all back something nice.

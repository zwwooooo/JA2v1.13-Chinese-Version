Turn the fuck around and take a hike!
Keep walkin,you fuckin blowjob!
You best be the postman, cause no one else is getting in here.
Are you fuckin' wit' me?
And who the fuck are you?
You must be one o' the new guys?
Forgeddaboutit!
You take a wrong turn? Go back the way you came!
Quit breaking my balls!
Aint nothing else matter, 'cept the family, you remember that.
Gotta get me some time in San Mona, fed up with this sand in my shoes.
How ya doin' tough guy?
Do I make you laugh? Do I amuse you?
They don't call this the 'beach of gold' for no reason, goomba.
Looking kinda ghetto there, you been spending time up North?

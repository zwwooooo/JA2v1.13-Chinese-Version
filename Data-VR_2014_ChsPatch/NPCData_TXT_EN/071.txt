Hello there. Who are you?
Ah, there you are again.
Hmm, they overran the camp from the north and the south. No chance.
I was able to hide from Deidranna's troops. The bastards attacked without warning.
No, I don't take alms!
In the former hideout of the rebels should be a contact person. We should meet him ...er...her!
No don't scream! Walls have ears.
No, let it be. I prefer working alone rather than with you.
Argh. I need a damn doctor!
Don't bother me, you are annoying.
Thank you!
You're a traitor, too! Die you human waste!
Excellent! I've fought in the killing fields in the south, I'll serve you well.
Yah, what's up? I'm the man, you need me!
Yup, I come with you. But I don't do it for nothing!
Hmm, interesting lecture. Ok, can I come? Now that I know what's going on?
I could become useful to you.
It's a pity. It's your own fault!
Oh, thank you! I might perhaps finally make it across the border this time?

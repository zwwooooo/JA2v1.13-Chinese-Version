Urgent!
We 'The Agency' are a daughter company of A.I.M. and believe you have a vested interest in the recent developments in Arulco.  To discuss assistance in a corporation intervention for the Cordona regime we would like to arrange a meeting with one of our sanction agents with you. ±
± The Agency ±
Organisation
We have checked your concerns that were outlined yesterday and agree to your conditions. Your operation will be supported with strategy papers provided. It is intended that we will give you additional orders according to clause *366 of our contract.  ±
± The Agency ±
Recon Report
Please find enclosed recent information collated on Arulco. ± ± We appreciate you utilising our services. ± ± R.I.S. ± ± <Enclosure in the FILE VIEWER ±
Insertion
Access to Omerta will be via parachute at dawn. The targeted drop zone is the bridge over the north river. Mixed intel suggest death squads commanded by Col. Ayala are heading to the same AO, if his troops reach Omerta before you eradicate all hostiles encountered before moving on. ±
± The Agency ±
Gratitude
Your recent performance has contributed to Miguel Cordona remaining alive. Proceed accordingly with your primary objective.
 ± The Agency ±
Success
Reports confirm your forward march has been successful. We would advise you to cooperate with the local population. Support the guerrilla fighters who are still operating near the border and in neighbouring mountains.
 ± The Agency ±
Positive reports
The recent reports we have heard are positive, but we would allude to you again that control of the oil and ore operations within the area are a central priority and will also provide necessary funding for a sustained operation.
 ± The Agency ±
The last action
Delay is not an option. The target is clear. Our agents have confirmed intel that the tyrant has tried to flee. Neighbouring countries have been requested to lockdown local airspaces. She must not get away!
± The Agency ±
One step back
We are aware this dictator is a formidable opponent, but do not despair. Regroup, recover and learn from this setback. ±
± The Agency ±
Expected adjustments
Setbacks should not be dwelled upon. The recent developments are temporary. Deidranna's forces have made calculated but not unexpected adjustments and this has only resulted in exposing weaknesses. ± ± We have faith in your command and your team to take advantage of them. ±
± The Agency ±
Biohazard
Sightings of creatures within the mines are yet to be fully authenticated, but if your reports are true, nothing should jeopardise Arulco's resource sector. ALL CREATURES ARE TO BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT. ±
LOCATION OR SOURCE OF CREATURES SHOULD BE DESTROYED. ± ± The Agency ±

If you don't come I'll send my men to kill you. I found you now, so I'll find you later, too. ±
Expecting your visit soon ± ± Kingpin ±
Lack of progress
We are fully aware that this operation is demanding. But we are highly concerned by your lack of progress. We expect your team to attack soon. ±
± The Agency ±
Concerned
The timing of this mission is a matter of urgency . For every day you stall and for every day that Deidranna's rule continues, more innocent lives are lost. You are ordered to take extreme action without prejudice ASAP. ±
±The Agency ±
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
It is of concern that you are continuing to procrastinate. Had the Agency known you were this ineffective we would have hired another operative. Your lack of initiative is unacceptable. Your poor performance has only extended the suffering of  Arulco's people, this is disappointing. Rectify this immediately. ±

It's me. John Kulba from Cleveland, Ohio. Looks like we've got another delay. ± ± I hired a helicoper pilot to fly me over the border to Arulco. But that punk crash-landed us in the middle of a goddamn nowhere! Never should've trust a damn hippie. ±

It's me. John Kulba from Cleveland, Ohio. ± ± Ok, so this time I hired a guide to get me to Arulco on foot. Next thing I know, we're surrounded by a pack of overgrown kitties, and that punk just makes a run for it, leaving me behind. Me, an American citizen, left as a cat treat! ±
Had to spend half a day on a tree before they were gone. I think this time I'll just get back to city and wait for the next direct flight. No need to worry. By the way, Arulco is spelled "Arulco" in Traconian too, right? ± ± See ya soon, ± John Kulba ±

Fwd: Arulco & World Bank
³ By Paul Tooley (The Arulcan) ³ 
² ³ ARULCANS GO BEGGING AS FOREIGN ADVISERS RAKE IT IN ³
Esmeralda Hokushin, a joint American-Arulcan citizen who lives mostly in Arulco, is treated as an outsider, paid in US dollars out of World Bank funds and grant money from individual nations. ±
In her current package, she earns a base of $170,400 and picks up a further $41,365 in travel expenses and living allowances, taking the package to $217,765. In comparison some heads of states in Western democracies earn only 10 percent more. ±
Weekly Leaks has obtained a number of current individual consultancy contracts for foreign advisers in Arulco's Ministry. Ms Hokushin's pay is at the lower end. ±
A former minister of the interim government during the mercenary revolution, Ricardo Grimaldo, says the fees are "obscene", given that Arulco is one of the poorest countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where more than 60 per cent of it's people earn less than $1 a day. ±
Lewis Rodney is a former Liberal who works in and out of Arulco. This year, he will earn $341,623 for providing 220 days work as a legal adviser to the Ministry of foreign affairs. Mr Rodney gets a further $49,824 for reimbursible costs and contingencies, taking his contract up to $391,447. ±
Ms Hokushin and Mr Rodney are not the issue. It is the World Bank, in conjunction with Arulco's Finance Minister, which has approved the extraordinary consultancies. He signs off on the contracts, which then go to the World Bank for final approval. ±
Representatives of the World Bank declined to comment, but a local emissary with connections to the organization pointed out "given the very small number of experienced and qualified Arulcan staff available, the pressing needs of the district require help from outside the country" ±
Arulco is now recognised as nationally rich because of oil, but there has been "a disconnect between the national income and personal incomes". ±
It is clear since the production sharing agreements signed between Arulco and Hale & Burton that revenues have risen steeply, but little of that money is available for immediate expenditure because of laws which oblige the Government to put the bulk into a trust fund. ±
Since the rule of the Queen has been reinstated, it is of some surprise that figures estimated over 2 billion dollars has been made in Arulco but seemingly not spent in Arulco. ±

Fwd: Intercepted Letter
The prison system of Arulco has grown despite the bombing of Tixa, but such amenities that are considered a human right do not apply in Arulco. ±
Weekly Leaks couldn't find records of consumable drinking water let alone an internet connection to eavesdrop on, however while seemingly unrelated, we did manage to acquire an interesting message passed on to us by a former collegue of Jack Durham, still working for the US Postal Service in the dead letter dept. ±
This message was only flagged due to a partial return address of 'The Big House, Sth Arulco' and a barely decipherable send to address: 'Momma Jones, Elysium Lawns, Alabama'. ±
The word Elysium had been written three times incorrectly then scribbled over and it appears the fourth was written by someone else entirely different. ±
Inside the letter is no more decipherable, written in a scratchy, forceful script that looks somewhere between an infant's handwriting and dog's paw scratching against a locked door. ± ±
Some parts that were legible read: ±
The Qweens officer bosses like Bubba, speshlly when I cram
the pensil-neckd prizners 4 to a sell, ±
as well as: ±
shawks I actually get a larger plate given to me in the canteen as a bonus! ±
No further information could be garnered, and no 'Elysium Lawns' could be tracked to Alabama, the closest address the USP service could match was a school for Autistic children but in Louisiana, rather than Alabama. ±
Correspondence ends here. ±







Fwd: Military Anti-Theft System
An American automotive industry mogul was stopped yesterday at the airport gate in Amsterdam after his suitcase accidentally opened and several hundred ecstasy pills spilled out. ±
In the ensuing commotion, one of our trusted Weekly Leaks supporters in the customs office managed to secure other content of said suitcase. ±
Particularly interesting is a xerox copy of correspondence between the company official and General Kruntz, member of new Arulcan junta considered by other sources to be in charge of motorised infantry. ±
Apparently Arulcan grunts had serious problems with local farmers stealing their vehicles for parts (local agriculture was mechanized during Cordona's short rule, but has now crumbled again) - and what is also strongly implied by the General, is their own troops are selling vehicles for profit. ±
However, Kruntz's biggest concern seems to be visions of enemy forces in possession of army equipment and wreaking havoc with it. As he states "even an ice cream truck can become a weapon of mass destruction in their hands. Horrors I witnessed during the Mercenary Revolution send chills down my spine to this day." ±
Following promises of lucrative contracts and a series of bribes, even with official embargos still in motion, the company agreed to lease few of their specialists to create a thorough anti-theft system. The final design consists of break-proof locks, electronic immobiliser and a remote kill switch. ±
System parts where smuggled in country with "humanitarian aid" shipped from Detroit and fitted to army vehicles by company technicians currently "on vacation" in Arulco. For that purpose the local race track and its workshop facilities in Malino were temporarily taken over by military. ±
Despite all new security measures, at least one army jeep was recently commandeered by unknown parties and reported seen still driving around the north region of the country. ±
In the same letter, Kruntz demands a serious revision of the original design or the possiblity of acquiring units technically superior, such as the systems used by all Hale and Burton service vehicles that are used overseas. ±
The company official instead reassures him that the system is fool-proof, and the theft must have been a result of improper installation and is clearly just an isolated case. Vehicle sightings suggest the thief being just an accidental joyrider, and possibility of the vehicle ending up in enemy hands is negligible. ±
Correspondence ends here. ±








Fwd: Hale & Burton Dam bursts in Brazil
A dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Samprato, Brazil that is co-owned by Hale & Burton has burst, unleashing a deluge of thick, red toxic mud that has smothered two villages and killed at least 120 people, an official says. ±
More than 200 more were injured in the disaster in Brazil's south-eastern state, said Bajo Severino, a fire chief in the area. ±
Civil defence authorities could not confirm casualties and said numbers reported in Brazilian media were speculative. ±
At a media conference in the US, Hale & Burton representatives said it had yet to fully assess the extent of damage and casualties from the massive mudslide but did not comment on the cloak of darkness that has since covered the site with security personnel preventing reporters access to the area. ±
Authorities said it was evacuating about 700 people to higher ground from nearby villages of where television footage was able to show these now destitute people being herded onto trains like cattle. ±
Neighbouring districts have reported large sections of homes and debris gliding past in a receeding stream of mud and toxicity levels recorded in this area may result in even more evacuations. ±
"The situation is grim. It is dark. There is a lot of mud," Mr Severino said. "There is no way to survive under that." ±
Rescue crews attempted to search the muddy waters after nightfall. ±
Another emergency staff member who wanted to remain nameless said teams are having trouble reaching the site. ±
"The closest we could get was more than a kilometer away. We cannot get closer because of the mud, and then other access points are blocked by guards due to security concerns" he said. "We do not really know what happened." ±
Neither H&B nor the government have questioned speculations before the tragedy of environmental concerns and the previous attempt by local villagers protesting against the companies mining expansion of the area.  ±
The dam was holding tailings, a mining waste product of metal filings, water and chemicals. It was located near the Onyx Gold river, adding to fears of potential water contamination. ±

Fwd: Dolvich mercenary may work for Queen Deidranna
Russian Mercenary Ilya Dolvich, older brother of Ivan and Igor had been reported as serving for Queen Deidranna in Arulco for the past 3 months however there has been no sightings since press photographs were taken a month ago picturing him in combat fatigues carrying a machine gun and looking ferocious. ±
Cross referencing previously secured files from A.I.M. it was believed Ilya was orignally intending to sign a contract with the international mercenary agency for a sanction in Arulco but negotiations came to an abrupt end when Ilya refused to take less money than his younger brother. ±
It is beleived the Dolvich brothers have a history of competitiveness amongst each other and in particular between Ilya and Ivan the strong streak of sibling rivalry can often overboil. ±
Independent reports suggest Ilya was employed by the army of Arulco in a training capacity but has neither been seen in Alma or some of the more fortified outposts in the South. ±

Fwd: Designer of Denver International Airport tunnel network signs contract with Hale & Burton
Denver, the world's second largest international airport is reknowned for it's bizarre architecture, somewhat nonsensical location and heavily adorned secret society symbols furnishing it's walls not to mention an apocalyptic 32 foot high horse that greets visitors at it's entrance, but little more is known about ± 
it's large underground network of tunnels and bunker complexes other than that their existence has been confirmed from preliminary blueprints being discovered by late roving reporter Liz Tremayne, here at Weekly Leaks. ±
It has since been found that a recent update of Noodle's online image search algorithm connected signatures featured on these blue prints to a Christian Schade, a gifted veteran engineer and architect working for German conglomerate Meermann Aktiengesellschaft recently signed a new contract with H&B. ±
Schade, who's family was involved with 'Project Riesse' during World War II has been responsible for a number of low profile but high dollar projects in both Europe, the USA, South America and now possibly Arulco.  ±

Fwd: Dolvich Mercenary imprisoned by former employer
Ilya Dolvich, a mercenary veteran from Russia previously spotted working for the army of Arulco has been sighted in a hard labour camp south of Salinas. Intercepted recon photographs from the CIA and dept of agriculture show an embittered Ilya breaking rocks in what is believed to be a new state corrrection facility. ±
CIA records also have flagged chemical and biological weapons at the facility, one believed to be a lethal nerve gas. Arulco's prisons have a long dark history of using chemical agents against it's inmates, and an expanding cemetary on the way to Malino only suggests this history is growing. ±
It is not clear why Ilya has been incarcerated, but other local reports by villagers and Hale & Burton staff incriminate that Ilya was a heavy drinker, and was seen on more than one occassion having heated disagreements with Deputy Commander Morris usually under the influence of Vodka.
Attempts to acquire more information from both Igor and Ivan Dolvich have proven fruitless with neither responding to our calls.

Hale & Burton expands underground network 
Previously it was reported German engineer Christian Schade, responsible for the design of Denver International Airport's huge underground tunnel network had signed a contract with Hale & Burton. Travel documents now confirm Schade has been working in Arulco for the last three years and may connect ambitious ±
underground works that coincide with land reclamation projects in south-east Arulco. ±
It is believed the vast quantities of earth required came from ground works deep beneath the Arulcan soil and would suggest Arulco's underground network of tunnels and unused underground mines have been vastly expanded. This would also explain the large amounts of heavy truck traffic travelling on the highway just ±
north of the Playa D'Oro in the past, from the heart of Burton to Malino bay tranporting soil in the creation of the man-made island complex there. It has also been noted that Helicopter traffic is very common from these two locations despite air-strike threats from neighbouring Tracona. ±

Hale & Burton underground engineer is a war criminal
During a seizure by the IRS of funds being laundered through South America and Europe into North America it has been discovered that the previoulsy reported 'Christian Schade' is in fact wanted Nazi war criminal Wernher Zuchs.  Zuchs, a long-standing fugitive on the Intercept's Most Wanted list has been on the run ±
since WWII. Encrypted digital records and CCTV footage confirms Zuchs infamously known as 'The Dentist' during WWII due to his affinity for stealing the gold teeth from the dead has been present in southern sectors of Arulco and is belived to be working in the newer expanded tunnel networks for Hale and Burton. ±

Arulco freedom fighter used as torture tool in Iraq war prison
Findings during the Abu Ghraib torture trials in Iraq suggests Ira Smythe a humanitarian aid worker turned rebel freedom fighter in the country of Arulco may not be Missing in Action, presumed dead after all. ±
Evidence at the trial revealed that among human rights violations and war crimes carried out by the United States Army and CIA including physical abuse and torture Ira Smythe's voice had been used on some sleep deprivation programs with her voice played to prisoners on headphones at high volume in a repeating loop. ±
A representative of Ira Smythe's family confirmed the voice was indeed hers but also argued she had never worked or would work for a United States military force or an orginization such as the CIA. Ira herself was unable to attend the trial due to being currently on a missing persons list in South America. ±

End
Give Back Money!!!
Dear Mr Mercenary Leader, ±
You and your people are thieves and liars and cheats! ±
Promised holy semen is not working! I send nephew Samir to doctors on Salinas University, they saying it is not even bull! They hear story about super sperm and they joking and laughing! ±
Please, soon be bringing my 20,000 of money back! It is not for me to be telling what happening if not! Entire Salinas will be knowing your dishonest ways, You ugly, stinking, filthy scum! ±
± ± Yours sincerely ± Rajeev Bansall ±




Further Developments
I was convinced we'd managed to achieve a mutual agreement. As it turns out, that is not the case. ±
The sample you provided us with is fake, a forgery. Enough to fool the uneducated eye, but no match for expertise of specialists on my employer's bill. ±
While I cannot blame you for trying to play your little scheme to earn a quick buck, I'm very disappointed in your shortsightedness in who you chose to deal with. Did you really expect a small-timer like you can con the most powerful organization in the free world and get away with it? ±
I'll keep things simple. This is what you're going to do: You will find me. You will bring back the money you acquired by false pretenses. You will also cover all expenses of my employer. No checks, no substitutes, hard American cash only. Then we'll pretend that this entire business just didn't happen. ±
It's a one time only offer, viable for next 24 hours - I've already wasted enough time in this Godforsaken country. Comply, or my employer will have no other choice but to activate certain assets, which, I assure you, you do not want to be acquainted with. ±
I hope, for your own sake, you'll see reason. ±
